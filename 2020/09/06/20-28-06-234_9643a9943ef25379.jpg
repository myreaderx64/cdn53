<p><em>The No Asshole Rule</em> was published 10 years ago. It focused on building civilized workplaces. Yet the most frequent question that it provoked were variations of &quot;Help. I am dealing with an asshole (or a bunch of them), what do I do?&quot; &#0160;</p>
<p>People asked it in some form or another in the most of the 8000 or so emails that I got about that book and in hundreds of casual conversations. &#0160;I&#39;ve been asked it by numerous of journalists (for both professional and personal reasons) and by critics of <em>The No Asshole Rule</em> who complained that the book devoted just one short chapter to addressing it. &#0160;I&#39;ve heard it from all kinds of people of all kinds including cashiers at Costco, Jewish Cantors and Catholic Priests, executive assistants, &#0160;young lawyers who worked for nasty partners, old lawyers who worked with nasty clients, a CEO who felt oppressed by &quot;boardholes&quot; and &quot;douche boards,&quot; airline customers and pilots, and on and on.&#0160;</p>
<p>During the past decade, I took care to save the emails and other bits that people sent me about workplace jerks and other kinds of assholes. And I spent a few hours each week reading and cataloging the growing pile of academic research on all things asshole including abusive supervision, rudeness, &quot;mobbing,&quot; abusive customers, negative emotions, air rage, and such. &#0160;But it took me years to returned to writing about the asshole problem again.</p>
<p>I got distracted by writing two other books, other adventures such as the <a href="http://stvp.stanford.edu/doc">Designing Organizational Change Project</a>&#0160;at Stanford, and life in general. &#0160; But the ten year anniversary <em>The No Asshole Rule</em>&#0160;inspired me to&#0160;devote much of 2016 to writing a book that gives the best answers I can muster to all those people who keep asking me that question.&#0160;<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1328695913/bobsutton-20">The Asshole Survival Guide</a></em> was published in September 2017.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I am posting plug for my latest book on this old Work Matters blog, in part, as a kind of goodbye to the active life of this site. &#0160;I may still post stuff here occasionally, but I am now using my new <a href="https://www.bobsutton.net">All Things Bob Sutton</a> site as the main place where I post things and as the main first &quot;stop&quot; to find my work.</p>
<p>&#0160;This post completes a cycle that was started back in in 2006 when Diego Rodriguez of<a href="https://www.ideo.com/people/diego-rodriguez"> IDEO</a> and<a href="https://twitter.com/metacool?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> Metacool </a>fame convinced me to give this new fangled blogging thing a try. &#0160;Diego thought it would be a good way to create buzz for my forthcoming asshole book and he knew that I liked to write about leading and dealing with workplaces. &#0160;Over the past few years, I haven&#39;t been blogging here much, and most stuff I have written has appeared on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/influencer/15893932-Bob-Sutton">LinkedIn Influencer</a> pages, sometimes at <em><a href="https://hbr.org/search?term=robert+i.+sutton">Harvard Business Review</a></em>&#0160;and <a href="https://medium.com/@bobsutton">Medium</a>, and at stray places such as&#0160;<a href="https://www.inc.com/rebecca-hinds-and-bob-sutton/dropbox-secret-for-saving-time-in-meetings.html">INC</a> and the <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/bad-to-great-the-path-to-scaling-up-excellence">McKinsey Quarterly</a>. &#0160;</p>
<p>Yet when I look at this site, I am amazed by how how many pieces I&#39;ve posted here (many of which took a day or more to write), by the number, range, and quality of comments people have posted, by the wonderful lessons readers have taught me, and by all the connections I&#39;ve made with people who reached out to me. My first real post (after deleting a couple of experiments) appeared on june 13th, 2006. It was called <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/06/brainstorming_i.html">&quot;Brainstorming in the Wall Street Journal&quot;</a>:&#0160;I challenged a myth, or a least a severe oversimplification, that research proves brainstorming doesn&#39;t work. &#0160;My Typepad dashboard shows that there are 1180 posts on this site ( I wrote all but one or two) and 5648 reader comments. &#0160;The site has had almost 4 million pageviews (3868829) since it was launched and averages 975 views per day (I am sure many are bots!). &#0160;</p>
<p>I am not shutting down this site. Rather, I am going to pretty it up a little bit over the next couple weeks and keep it as an archive, which will remain at <a href="http://www.bobsutton.org">www.bobsutton.org</a>&#0160;and at <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/">bobsutton.typepad.com</a>&#0160;-- and I may update it in small ways now and then. &#0160; The new book prompted me to think about how I want to bring together my varied past work, including the stuff on this blog, and to provide one stop shopping for my new stuff as well. &#0160;So I just launched a new website called &quot;All Things Bob Sutton&quot; that is at<a href="https://www.bobsutton.net"> bobsutton.net </a>(which now directs you to the new site instead of this one). &#0160;I worked with&#0160;<a href="http://www.lizmortaticreative.com/">Liz Mortati</a>,a great web designer who Adam Grant recommended to me. The new site contains links to my various stuff, including this site, and to various other posts and articles, videos, and quizzes like the Asshole Rating Self-Exam <a href="http://electricpulp.com/guykawasaki/arse/">(ARSE)</a>. And it will be updated with new stuff I&#39;ve got cooking.&#0160;</p>
<p>I invite you to follow me to the new site. There will be a lot more action there this year than there has been at the Work Matters blog in a long time. And I especially want to thank everyone who has read this blog, made comments, spread the word about various posts, and written in me in recent years to nudge me to start posting here more often. &#0160;I hope you like the new place. &#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>&#0160;</p>
<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e201b8d0d5585f970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Mitch" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e201b8d0d5585f970c image-full img-responsive" src="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e201b8d0d5585f970c-800wi" title="Mitch" /></a></p>
<p>My Stanford colleague Huggy Rao and I devoted seven years to learning about what it takes to scale up excellence in organizations. We studied how leaders and teams build and identify pockets of goodness in organizations and spread such goodness to more people and places -- about the moves needed to grow organizations and to spread superior practices and programs throughout organizations.</p>
<p>We found many splendid consequences of successful scaling: The wealth and jobs created by companies such as IKEA, Google, Procter &amp; Gamble, Facebook, and Starbucks. The needless deaths in U.S. hospitals that were prevented by the 100,000 Lives Campaign between 2004 and 2006 – a successful effort to spread evidence-based practices that was led by a small non-profit called the Institute for Health Improvement. And the thousands of poor children in Africa who are now receiving a superior education (for about five dollars per month) from&#0160;<a href="http://www.bridgeinternationalacademies.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bridge International Academies</a>, a fast growing, for profit, chain of nursery and primary schools.</p>
<p>Yet, despite our society&#39;s penchant for worshipping such successes, bigger isn&#39;t always better. Success is rarely all it is cracked up to be. And our dreams often lose much of their grandeur when they come true.</p>
<p>If you are in throes of a scaling challenge, or plan to tackle one soon, you might try a form of imaginary time travel. Pretend that a few years have passed, that you and your colleagues have achieved your scaling dreams, and that you are looking back from the future. We&#39;ve found that this&#0160;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140911210925-15893932-why-you-need-a-time-machine-to-make-big-decisions/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&quot;looking back from the future&quot;</a>&#0160;approach helps leaders and teams with all sorts of scaling decisions. One good question to ask is &quot;Are we happy in the world that we worked so hard to build?&quot;</p>
<p>As we show in&#0160;<em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385347022/bobsutton-20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Scaling Up Excellence</a></em>, and&#0160;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/article/20140112221140-15893932-hierarchy-is-good-hierarchy-is-essential-and-less-isn-t-always-better/edit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this piece</a>&#0160;on LinkedIn, as an organization grows, whether you like it or not, it will require more hierarchical layers, managers, rules, and (often) annoying administrative processes. It will also become increasingly difficult to maintain personal relationships with all your colleagues (let alone learn their names). The pressures created by a large and successful company or change program often push founding leaders and teams to their limits, require them to do chores that they despise, and to work with people that they find to be bad company. Alas, even if scaling up brings you acclaim and riches, you may be uncomfortable within the walls of your own creation.</p>
<p>Consider this story. About fifteen years ago, I had striking conversations with&#0160;<a href="http://www.kapor.com/bio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mitch Kapor&#0160;</a>and his wife<a href="http://kaporcenter.org/author/freada/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">&#0160;Freada Klein</a>&#0160;about their experiences at the Lotus Development Corporation. Lotus began as a small firm that Kapor started with a few friends in 1982. Lotus 1-2-3, the company’s spreadsheet, quickly became the hottest-selling program for the (then new) IBM personal computer: sales hit 50 million dollars in 1983 and jumped to over 150 million by 1984. Kapor didn’t have the desire or temperament to run a big company, so he remained chairman and promoted ex-McKinsey consultant Jim Manzi to CEO. Manzi grew Lotus to over one thousand people by 1985 and stocked it with many “sales types” and “process types” from traditional corporations such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Coca-Cola, and IBM. Kapor and other early Lotus employees enjoyed their new wealth, but many were counterculture types who chafed at the corporate attitudes and trappings that prevailed: “The thrill of the start-up had turned into the drill of a major corporation,” as author Robert Cringely put it.</p>
<p>In 1985, Freada Klein (then head of organizational development) did an experiment that confirmed that Lotus had become a place where its founders were misfits. With Kapor’s permission, Klein pulled together the résumés of the first forty Lotus employees. On most resumes, Klein only altered the employees’ names, but she changed Kapor’s more extensively because his past as a transcendental meditation teacher and disk jockey was known throughout Lotus. Klein explained that most of these early employees had skills the growing company needed, but many had done “risky and wacko things” such as being community organizers, being clinical psychologists, living at an ashram, or like Kapor, teaching transcendental meditation. Then Klein did something sneaky. She submitted all forty resumes to the Lotus human resources department. Not one of the forty applicants, including Kapor, was invited for a job interview. The founders had built a world that rejected people like them.</p>
<p>Kapor stepped down as Lotus’s chairman in 1986 because “it wasn’t my ambition to run a big company. I wanted to do this great product and make a big business out of it. But I didn’t find the positive parts of running this big show to be very gratifying. . . . I like to be left alone to do my own thing. But instead, I was a prisoner of the spreadsheet.” Lotus was eventually bought by IBM for $3.5 billion. Since leaving Lotus, Kapor has spent his time working with small companies and nonprofits, where he feels more at home.</p>
<p>I love Kapor’s story because it has so many lessons. It shows that the people who develop great ideas are often ill-suited to run, or even build, the big companies or programs required to spread and sell them. And, as one wise venture capitalist often reminds me, some of the best entrepreneurs and innovators dedicate their days to starting and building social worlds that they will abhor living in – and, as Kapor discovered, that will never hire people like them!</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>The first time I taught an introductory organizational behavior class was in 1980 or 1981. I was a second-year doctoral student in organizational psychology at The University of Michigan. &#0160;I had no teaching experience (except for one guest lecture I had given to a large undergrad&#0160;class -- it was terrible; harried and dull). Yet that didn&#39;t stop the the Michigan Business School from giving me the chance to teach the class to some 60 students. I sure learned a lot that year... I still remember the strapping 250 pound football player who broke down in tears after he failed a test (to his credit, he passed the class once he started studying harder). &#0160;</p>
<p>I have taught various versions of the class perhaps 35 times by now, and in some ways it remains the same. &#0160;There are certain topics that, at least in my view, always ought to be included such as motivation, employee selection and socialization, influence, leadership, and teams. &#0160;Over the years, I have started emphasizing innovation and organizational culture a bit more, and I do focus more explicitly on evidence-based management and the challenges of weaving academic research with real managerial decisions and actions. &#0160;</p>
<p>And perhaps the main change is that I do straight lecture less and introduce more interaction. &#0160;Although I still present material, I press students more to comment, to do lots of short writing assignments, to work in teams, to do short presentations, and to do in-class interactive exercises. I also bring in more people from the &quot;real world&quot; who can bring the lessons from the class alive. Every year, I add another small element or two to make the class a bit more interactive and realistic. And now, I put most of the materials on an online platform called&#0160;<a href="https://novoed.com/" target="_self">NovoEd</a>, which makes things a lot easier. &#0160;But the heart of the class happens live -- the platform just makes things easier.&#0160;&#0160;It still is a different animal than the leadership class that I help to teach at the Stanford d.school, as there is still a lot of discussion, reading, and writing, while the <a href="http://dschool.stanford.edu/d-leadership/" target="_self">&quot;d.leadership&quot; </a>class entails embedding duos in organizations with the aim of making them more creative.&#0160;</p>
<p><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e201bb07d165e9970d img-responsive">My favorite part of the organizational behavior class is the final exam. Students learn the question on the very first day of class: &quot;Design the ideal organization: Use course concepts to defend your answer.&quot; &#0160;It is VERY difficult, it forces students to think all term about which lessons matter most and how they fit together, and the best exams are astoundingly good. &#0160;And when students try to write it the night before (despite all sorts of measures to stop them, including a draft due about 10 days before the deadline), it shows. &#0160;I wrote a <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/04/final-exam-design-the-ideal-organization-use-course-concepts-to-defend-your-answer.html" target="_self">post here on the final</a> a few years back, and as I said, I guess my answer to the question is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446698202/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>The No Asshole Rule!</em></a>&#0160;although I didn&#39;t restrict myself to 2000 or 3000 words!&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e201bb07d165e9970d img-responsive">I start teaching it again in a few days, and I am, as usual, quite excited to do so. &#0160; Here is the outline&#0160;if you are interested (note that about 80% of the links are live and most of the readings are free to anyone):&#0160;<a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/files/280_syllabus_2015winter_in_class_jan3rdris.pdf">280_Syllabus_2015Winter_In_Class_JAN3rdRIS</a>.&#0160;</span></p>
<p><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e201bb07d165e9970d img-responsive">This class is taught in the the Stanford Engineering School, as is our d.school class (the d.school is also part of the Engineering School, although a lot of MBAs do take our classes), but I do think that, despite all the hand wringing about how irrelevant traditional management education is becoming and how the MBA education is going to become &quot;disrupted&quot; is overblown. &#0160;Yes, we are moving things onto the web for efficiency reasons, and a lot of the stuff on the web is becoming more social, interactive, and realistic. </span></p>
<p><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e201bb07d165e9970d img-responsive">But there is still no substitute for a live class discussion, having an in person interaction with someone like IDEO&#39;s marketing head&#0160;<a href="http://www.ideo.com/people/whitney-mortimer" target="_self"> Whitney Mortimer</a> or earlier stage venture capitalist<a href="http://www.harrisonmetal.com/" target="_self"> Michael Dearing</a>, or sitting down, face to face, and going through line after line of a draft with a student. &#0160;In fact,my view is that what we&#39;ve been learning from online education is teaching us to make in-class education better (to focus on what works best live and in-person) and what we learn in-class makes online education better (e.g., an online &quot;lecture&quot; is a lot better after you have given it live to 10 or 15 groups). &#0160;In addition, it many cases, the dividing line between &quot;online&quot; and &quot;off&quot; is blurring, as we might give students an assignment online, then have them do it live in-class or in a company, and then perhaps post it on an online platform. &#0160;</span></p>
<p><span class="asset  asset-generic at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e201bb07d165e9970d img-responsive">So while there always be bumps along the way, I am optimistic that &quot;traditional&quot; business education is changing for the better as a result of all the online stuff, and the online stuff will keep getting better too, but it won&#39;t go away anytime soon.&#0160;</span></p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e201b7c722372e970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Cvr9780743262132_9780743262132_lg" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e201b7c722372e970b img-responsive" height="356" src="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e201b7c722372e970b-800wi" title="Cvr9780743262132_9780743262132_lg" width="238" /></a></p>
<p>I have been maintaining – and occasionally updating -- a list of “Books Every Leader Should Read” on this Work Matters blog since 2011. These are books that have taught me much about people, teams, and organizations -- while at the same time -- provide useful guidance (if sometimes indirectly) about what it takes to lead well versus badly. This is the latest update. I just updated the list over at LinkedIn and have included it here as well. I have expanded it to 12 books this year and, even with that, I left out many of my favorites – and probably many of yours as well. After all, some 11,000 business books are published in the United States every year.</p>
<p>Many on the list are research based, others tell detailed stories, and only two are quick reads (<em>Orbiting the Giant Hairball</em> and <em>Parkinson’s Law</em>). That reflects my bias. I lean toward books that have real substance beneath them. This runs counter to the belief in the business book world at the moment that people will only buy and read books that are very short and simple – and have just one idea. So, if your kind of business book is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Minute-Manager-Kenneth-Blanchard/dp/0688014291/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324403987&amp;sr=8-1" target="_self"><em>The One Minute Manager</em></a> (which frankly, I like too... but you can read the whole thing in 20 or 30 minutes), then you probably won&#39;t like most of these books.</p>
<p>1. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/142219857X/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>The Progress Principle</em> </a>by Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer. A masterpiece of evidence-based management -- the strongest argument I know that &quot;the big things are the little things.</p>
<p>2. <em>I<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006124189X/bobsutton-20" target="_self">nfluence</a></em> by Robert Cialdini. The classic book about how to persuade people to do things, how to defend against persuasion attempts, and the underlying evidence. I have been using this in class at Stanford for over 25 years, and I have had dozens of students say to me years later &quot;I don&#39;t remember much else about your class, but I still use and think about that Cialdini book.&quot;</p>
<p><br /> <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e201b7c7223825970b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Book-mts" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e201b7c7223825970b img-responsive" height="293" src="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e201b7c7223825970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Book-mts" width="224" /></a>3.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400064287/bobsutton-2" target="_self"><em> Made to Stick</em></a> by Chip and Dan Heath. A modern masterpiece, already a classic after just a few years. How to design ideas that people will remember and act on. I still look at it a couple times a month and I buy two or three copies at a time because people are always borrowing it from me. I often tell them to keep it because they rarely give it back anyway. And, for my tastes, it has the best business book cover of all time -- the duct tape even looks and feels real.</p>
<p>4. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374275637/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em></a>&#0160;TDaniel Kahneman. Even though the guy won the Nobel Prize, this book is surprisingly readable. A book about how we humans really think, and although it isn&#39;t designed to do this, Kahneman also shows how and why so much of the stuff you read in the business press is crap.</p>
<p>5. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1422115151/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>Collaboration</em> </a>by Morten Hansen. He wrote a hot bestseller with Jim Collins, Great By Choice, which is OK, but this is a better and more important book. I have read it three times and, in my view, it is -- by far -- the best book ever written about what it takes to build an organization where people share information, cooperate, and help each other succeed.</p>
<p>6.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670879835/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em> Orbiting the Giant Hairball</em></a> by Gordon MacKenzie. It is hard to explain, sort of like trying to tell a stranger about rock and roll, as the old song goes. But it is one of the two best creativity books ever written, and one of the best business books of any kind – even though it is nearly an anti-business book. Gordon&#39;s voice and love creativity and self-expression -- and how to make it happen despite the obstacles that unwittingly heartless organizations put in the way -- make this book a joy.</p>
<p><br /> <a class="asset-img-link" href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e201b7c72237eb970b-pi" style="float: left;"><img alt="Creativity-Inc." class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e201b7c72237eb970b img-responsive" height="221" src="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e201b7c72237eb970b-320wi" style="margin: 0px 5px 5px 0px;" title="Creativity-Inc." width="146" /></a>7.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812993012/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em> Creativity,Inc.</em></a> by Ed Catmull. One of the best business/leadership/organization design books ever written – this and Hairball are a great pair. I wrote a more detailed review of Ed’s wonderful book here. As I wrote in my blurb, and this is no B.S., “This is the best book ever written on what it takes to build a creative organization. It is the best because Catmull’s wisdom, modesty, and self-awareness fill every page. He shows how Pixar’s greatness results from connecting the specific little things they do (mostly things that anyone can do in any organization) to the big goal that drives everyone in the company: making films that make them feel proud of one another. I read this book from cover to cover again about a month ago – there is so much there as Ed brings in so much of his amazing life and gleans so many lessons about leadership and life I confess that I am biased about this book. I have met Ed several times and swayed by his modesty, smarts and how well he listens. The last time we met, Ed told me a great story. He and his editor were having trouble with the flow of the book. So he asked a couple of the Pixar script writers who worked on the film Monsters INC to read the draft and make suggestions. Ed said they spotted the problem right away and came up with a great solution. Ed has resources that other authors don’t! That beautiful cover is a Pixar design too.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578513332/bobsutton-20" target="_self">8<em>. Leading Teams</em></a> by the late J. Richard Hackman. When it comes to the topic of groups or teams, there is Hackman and there is everyone else. If you want a light feel good romp that isn&#39;t very evidence-based, read The Wisdom of Teams. If want to know how teams really work and what it really takes to build, sustain, and lead them from a man who was immersed in the problem as a researcher, coach, consultant, and designer for over 40 years, this is the book for you. Oh, and if you want the cheat sheet – although you are missing enough that you are mostly cheating yourself -- check out Hackman’s HBR piece, the very definition of profound simplicity, a lifetime of wisdom and (I am guessing) the results of 1000 studies summarized in six concise points.</p>
<p>9.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670026557/bobsutton-20" target="_self"> <em>Give and Take</em> </a>by Adam Grant. Adam is the hottest organizational researcher of his generation. When I read the pre-publication version, I was so blown away by how useful, important, and interesting that Give and Take was that I gave it one of the most enthusiastic blurbs of my life: “Give and Take just might be the most important book of this young century. As insightful and entertaining as Malcolm Gladwell at his best, this book has profound implications for how we manage our careers, deal with our friends and relatives, raise our children, and design our institutions. This gem is a joy to read, and it shatters the myth that greed is the path to success.&quot; In other words, Adam shows how and why you don&#39;t need to be a selfish asshole to succeed in this life. America -- and the world -- would be a better place if all of us memorized and applied Adam&#39;s worldview. I love this book -- I give to Stanford students and executives all the time, especially when they worry aloud that, to get ahead, their only choice is to be a selfish asshole.</p>
<p>10. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1568490151/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>Parkinson’s Law</em>&#0160;</a>by the late C. Northcote Parkinson. You’ve probably heard of Parkinson’s Law, which he first proposed in The Economist in 1955: “It is a commonplace observation that work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion.” I had as well, but I never knew much about C. Northcote Parkinson, nor had I read his 1958 gem of the same name (I didn&#39;t even know it existed) until Huggy Rao and I started writing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385347022/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>Scaling Up Excellence</em> </a>and my well read co-author pointed me to this collection of essays. Parkinson was quite a guy -- a scholar of public administration, naval historian, and author of over 60 books. For our scaling book, I was especially taken with his arguments, evidence, and delightfully polite English sarcasm about the negative and predictable effects of group size and administrative bloat. I am also a big fan of The Peter Principle, which is similar in some ways, (I wrote the forward to the 40 Anniversary Edition – read it here) but Parkinson’s Law is an even better book.</p>
<p>11. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594631905/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>To Sell is Human</em></a>, By Dan Pink. You might ask, what does this have to do with management and leadership? Read the book. Dan does a masterful job of showing how, to lead and motivate others, to protect and enhance of the reputations of the people, teams, and organizations we care about, and to have successful careers as well, we all need to be able to sell people our ideas, products, solutions, and yes, ourselves. Dan’s ability as a storyteller is what makes this book stand above so many others -- his stories are not only compelling, they make evidence-based principles come alive. To be honest, I had not devoted much attention to this book until my wife picked up a copy and read the whole thing from start to finish in about a day. She then spent the next week raving about all the ways Dan&#39;s book would help her as CEO of a non-profit – in everything from fundraising, to inspiring employees and volunteers, to dealing with the media, to convincing new prospects to join her organization’s board. Then I read it myself. As much as I admire Malcolm Gladwell, I believe that Dan Pink just might be the most skilled writer we have at translating behavioral science research. His stuff is so fun to read, it doesn&#39;t distort or exaggerate findings, and he does a masterful job of teaching us how to apply the lessons in his books.</p>
<p>12.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671244094/bobsutton-20" target="_self"> <em>The Path Between the Seas</em></a> by historian David McCullough. On building the Panama Canal. This is a great story of how creativity happens at a really big scale. It is messy. Things go wrong. People get hurt. But they also triumph and do astounding things. I also like this book because it is the antidote to those who believe that great innovations all come from start-ups and little companies (although there are some wild examples of entrepreneurship in the story -- especially the French guy who designs Panama&#39;s revolution -- including a new flag and declaration of independence as I recall -- from his suite in the Waldorf Astoria in New York, and successfully sells the idea to Teddy Roosevelt). As my Stanford colleague Jim Adams points out, the Panama Canal, the Pyramids, and putting a man on moon are just a few examples of great human innovations that were led by governments. If you want to learn about what world class scaling “clusterfug” looks like, read about how the French messed things up – and if you want to learn about skilled scaling (with some horrible side-effects) and the amazing U.S. President Teddy Roosevelt, find the time to read this rather massive masterpiece.</p>
<p>I almost added a 13th book:<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1455554790/bobsutton-20" target="_self"> <em>Work Rules</em></a> by Google’s head of “People Operations” Laszlo Bock, which will published in April 2015. I am about two-thirds through an advance copy; it is a compelling and relentlessly useful guide to how Google selects, evaluates, motivates, and keep learning from its people. I especially love the chapters on “Don’t Trust Your Gut” and “It’s Not All Rainbows and Unicorns” (about Google’s biggest people management mistakes). Perhaps I will include it next year as I am captivated by Bock’s insights and spirited writing.</p>
<p>I would love to know of your favorites -- and if want a systematic approach to this question, don&#39;t forget <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591842409/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>The 100 Best Business Books of All Time</em></a>.</p>
<p>P.S. For self-defense, I still recommend that we all read Isaacson&#39;s <em>Steve Jobs</em> – even though it has been a few years, I still keep going places -- parties, family gatherings, talks I give and attend, and even the grocery store where people start talking about Jobs and especially arguing about him. As I explained in <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/07/wired-story-wraps-with-my-argument-that-steve-jobs-is-like-a-rorschach-test.html" target="_self"><em>Wired</em></a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446556076/bobsutton-20" target="_self">Go<em>od Boss, Bad Boss</em></a>, I have come to believe that whatever Jobs was in life, in death he has become a Rorschach test -- we all just project our beliefs and values on him. That said, Ed Catmull’s chapter on Jobs in Creativity INC. is one of the most compelling defenses of this controversial character I have read.</p>
<p>P.P.S. Also, a big thanks to Chris Fry, who has held senior positions at Salesforce.com and Twitter, and is one of the heroes in our book<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385347022/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em> Scaling Up Excellence</em></a>. Chris urges me to maintain this list – and for offers gentle complaints when I add something that he believes isn&#39;t as good as he had hoped. Chris’s favorite book on the list is<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671244094/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em> Path Between the Seas</em></a>.</p>

<p>I was exchanging emails with a colleague that used to be at the Stanford d.school and now works with schools. &#0160;He menionted Brad Bird, which reminded my of an <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/innovation/innovation_lessons_from_pixar_an_interview_with_oscar-winning_director_brad_bird" target="_self">interview</a> that Huggy Rao and I did with him in 2008 for the McKinsey Quarterly, just before he won his second Academy Award (for directing <em>Ratatouille)</em>.&#0160;</p>
<p>It ended with a great quote that I just love:</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Walt Disney’s mantra was, “I don’t make movies to make money—I make money to make movies.” That’s a good way to sum up the difference between Disney at its height and Disney when it was lost. It’s also true of Pixar and a lot of other companies. It seems counterintuitive, but for imagination-based companies to succeed in the long run, making money can’t be the focus.</p>
<div>Speaking personally, I want my films to make money, but money is just fuel for the rocket. What I really want to do is to go somewhere. I don’t want to just collect more fuel.</div>
<div>&#0160;</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Not bad, huh?&#0160;</div>

<p><em>I also posted this piece over at<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140303152358-15893932-why-big-teams-suck" target="_self"> LinkedIn</a> this morning. &#0160;It offers a simple lesson, but one that is often disregarded, and in turn undermines the team and organizational performance, creates dysfunctional conflict. and weakens social bonds.&#0160;</em></p>
<p>In 1957, British naval historian and management satirist&#0160;<a href="https://www.economist.com/node/13976732" target="_blank">Northcote Parkinson</a>&#0160;painted a cynical picture of a typical committee: It starts with four or five members, quickly grows to nine or ten, and, once it balloons to 20 and beyond, meetings become an utter waste of time – and all the important work is done before and after meetings by four or five most influential members.</p>
<p>As Parkinson would have it, numerous studies now confirm that, when it comes to teams, many hands do not make light work. After devoting nearly 50 years to studying team performance, the late Harvard researcher&#0160;<a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/7317.html" target="_blank">J. Richard Hackman</a>&#0160;concluded that four to six members is the team best size for most tasks, that no work team should have more than 10 members, and that performance problems and interpersonal friction increase “exponentially as team size increases.”</p>
<p>These troubles arise because larger teams place often overwhelming “cognitive load” on individual members. Most of us are able to mesh your efforts with and maintain good personal relationships with, say, three or four teammates. But as a group expands further, each member devotes more time to coordination chores (and less time to actually doing the work), more hand-offs between the growing cast of members are required (creating opportunities for miscommunication and mistakes), and because each member must divide his or her attention among a longer list of colleagues, the team’s social glue weakens (and destructive conflict soars). Following this<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20140220150343-15893932-five-rocks-miller-s-magical-number-seven-plus-or-minus-two-and-the-subtraction-game-at-builddirect-why-scaling-is-a-problem-of-more-and-less?trk=mp-reader-card" target="_blank">&#0160;LinkedIn piece</a>, findings about group size are reminiscent of psychologist George Miller’s famous conclusion that seven was a “magical number” because people could only hold “seven, plus or minus two” numbers in short-term memory. Both Hackman and Miller found that, once people start trying to deal with double digits, the cognitive overload takes a toll.</p>
<p>These findings help explain why the average restaurant reservation in the United States is for a party of four. Think of the last time you were at a dinner with a group of 10 or 15 people. It is difficult, perhaps downright impossible, to have a coherent and emotionally satisfying conversation that engages each member of the party all at once. Typically, the group breaks into a series of smaller conversations or a few people do all the talking and the others say little or nothing.</p>
<p>Some organizations learn about the drawbacks of oversized groups the hard way. Retired Marine Captain and former U.S. Senator&#0160;<a href="http://www.jameswebb.com/about.htm" target="_blank">James H. Webb</a>&#0160;explained why the “fire team” – the basic combat fighting unit – shrunk from 12 to 4 during War II. Webb wrote in the&#0160;<em>Marine Corp Gazette</em>&#0160;that this “12 man mob” was “immensely difficult” for Marine squad leaders to control under the stress and confusion of battle. Coordination problems were rampant and close relationships – where soldiers fight for their buddies – were tougher to maintain in 12-man teams. The U.S, Navy Seals have learned that four is the optimal size for a combat team as well. And, the basic work unit at McKinsey, the consulting firm, is one “engagement manager” and three other members. As Intuit’s CEO Brad Smith puts it, when it comes to teams, “less is often best.” Just like on­line retailing giant Amazon, Intuit insists: “Our development teams can be no larger than the number of people who can be fed by two pizzas,” which helps them “stay nimble and make decisions quickly.”</p>
<p>This lesson applies to small organizations too.&#0160;<a href="https://www.pulse.me/" target="_blank">Pulse News</a>, makers of a “news aggrega­tor” app, was started in mid-2010. Communication breakdowns and misunderstandings flared-up after it grew slightly, from three to eight people. Founders Akshay Kothari and Ankit Gupta told us that, after they divided those eight among three teams, people produced better software, did it faster, and argued less. When Pulse expanded to about 12 people (working in four teams, all in the same room), each team maintained a bulletin board that captured their current work to help everyone at Pulse follow what they were doing. Every afternoon at about 3:30, each team also gave a short talk to the company about what they working on and where they needed help. Pulse relied on small teams as it grew to 25 employees and 30 million users; it is now part of LinkedIn, which bought Pulse for 90 million dollars in April, 2013.</p>
<p>The lesson is that, if you are on a big team that keeps screwing up, where members don’t care much about each other, and are fighting like crazy, try some subtraction or division. A Harvard Business School study by&#0160;<a href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/melissa-valentine" target="_blank">Melissa Valentine</a>&#0160;and&#0160;<a href="http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6451" target="_blank">Amy Edmondson</a>&#0160;of a large hospital’s emergency department demonstrates how powerful such moves can be. The crowd of 30 or so doctors and nurses who staffed the department at any given time were divided into multiple six person “pods,” each led by a senior doctor or “attending physician.” After the change, information about patients flowed more quickly and accurately and personal relationships improved markedly. Smaller teams reduced confusion and discomfort about who to ask for help and updates.</p>
<p>One nurse said, before the pods, “You had to walk across the ED all timid” and get up bit of courage and say to the doctor “Uh, excuse me?” With the pods, “Now they are in the trenches with us.” It was also easier to discern which “podmates” were responsible for particular chores and deserved credit or blame when things went well or badly.</p>
<p>Another nurse added:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now there is much more of a sense of ownership of each other. I’ll say, “My pod isn’t running well. Where is my doctor?” And he’ll be accountable to me. And the doctors will say, “Where are my nurses, who do I have today?’” People rarely, if ever, claimed each other in this way before the pods were implemented even if they were working together on many shared cases. A resident would have used more detached language like, “Who is this patient’s nurse?” – ignoring that the nurse had any relationship to&#0160;<em>him</em>&#0160;– rather than, “Where are my nurses?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The pods also created big efficiency gains. Valentine and Edmondson analyzed data on 160,000 patients served by the Department during the six months before the pods were created and the year after. After the pods, patient throughput time plummeted by about 40%, from about eight hours (8.34) to five hours (5.29) per patient –without increased staffing levels. This drop not only reflects more efficient use of staff; think of the patients’ experience: Five hours at the hospital sucks a lot less than eight.</p>
<p>The upshot? As my co-author Huggy Rao and I found in our research,&#0160;<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385347022/bobsutton-20" target="_blank">scaling</a>&#0160;is a problem of both more and less. Many hands do not always make for light work, especially when it comes to team size. The first question I ask when a team reports they are locked in dysfunctional conflict, suffering from indifference, making bad decisions, or missing deadlines -- or all of the above -- is “how big is it?” If the answer is more than then five or six members, especially more than than ten, some savvy subtraction or division can create striking improvements. As Valentine and Edmondson&#39;s research shows: Leaders become more effective. Efficiency improves. Interpersonal friction wanes. And strangers become friends.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e201a50ff554aa970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Photo office" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e201a50ff554aa970c image-full img-responsive" src="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e201a50ff554aa970c-800wi" title="Photo office" /></a><br />A few years back, one of my closest friends at Stanford, <a href="http://engineering.stanford.edu/profile/sbarley">Steve Barley</a>, made a comment that I still think of often “If you are what you do, then I am a sociologist.”&#0160; Steve was making a general point (drawn from sociological theory on identity) and a specific point about himself.&#0160; The general point was that the behavior that people display – regardless of their intentions and the claims they make to others – are the best indicator of both their sense of self and of how others see them.&#0160; The specific point was that, although Steve is an engineering professor and his doctorate is from MIT’s Sloan School of Management, because of the intellectual tools he uses day after day in his research – things like social network theory, ethnographic methods, and theories of the sociology of work and technology – he sees himself as a sociologist (and most other scholars do too). &#0160;</p>
<p>I have been thinking of Steve’s comment because, as I have looked back on the last year (and my last 30 years as a professor at Stanford), if you are what you do, then I am a writer.&#0160;&#0160; Of course, how skilled a writer I am is for others to judge.&#0160;&#0160; But if I look back over the past three years (especially September of 2012 through October of 2013) pretty much all I did most days was to work on the text of<em> Scaling Up Excellence</em>.&#0160; Of course, my co-author Huggy Rao was involved heavily.&#0160; We had daily discussions about the language, lessons, theory, examples, and flow.&#0160; And Huggy was constantly introducing new practices and examples, and wrote initial drafts of many parts of the book.&#0160; But as the book unfolded, our roles became clear: the final drafting and editing, and compulsive rounds of revision were mostly my job.&#0160;&#0160; This was partly because I am a control freak, partly because this my sixth business book (Huggy’s past writing had focused mainly on academic writings), and –- to return to Steve Barley’s test –- I realized that I am happiest and feel most comfortable in my own skin when I am writing, reading a draft, re-writing it, or thinking about writing.</p>
<p>If you start with graduate school in the late 1970s, although I did other things necessary for writing peer reviewed articles – interviews, designing and collecting survey data, data analysis, meetings with co-authors, and reading related research – my main work activity for the last 35 years&#0160;day after day has been writing. What I wrote changed as I moved from being a doctoral student, to assistant professor working to get tenure, to mid-career researcher, to, now, as an academic who is mostly interested in applying academic rigor to helping people in organizations tackle real problems. &#0160;But writing was and is the main thing I do and want to do.</p>
<p>During the final years of <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385347022/bobsutton-20">Scaling Up Excellence</a></em>, when people asked me what was I up to, I often joked that I was trying to type myself out of solitary confinement in my garage (see above picture – that is where I do most of my serious writing and what it looks like now).&#0160; But when they said “that must be tough” or “aren’t you lonely,” I said that, when it comes to my work, I am happiest when I am by myself writing.&#0160;&#0160; This sentiment often surprises people, as I seem like such an extrovert.&#0160; And I do like being around other people – just not too much!&#0160;</p>
<p>Another sign that my identity is as a writer is evident in what I read for fun.&#0160; Huggy, who is one of the leading quantitative organizational researchers on the planet, reads statistic books for pleasure.&#0160; In contrast, I have always read books about the craft of writing for pleasure (and inspiration).&#0160; My belief that academics would be better writers if they read such books has got me in trouble:&#0160; When I was an editor at an academic journal called the <em>Administrative Science Quarterly</em>, I sent a copy of Strunk &amp; White’s classic <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-Elements-Style-Fourth-Edition/dp/020530902X/ref=sr_1_1/190-4217437-3646659?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388174966&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=white+strunk">Elements of Style</a></em> to a renowned scholar (she wrote terrible sentences).&#0160; She never spoke to me again (but I did detect some improvement in her writing). I especially love some of the old “Writers at Work” interviews published in the Paris Review – especially <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writers-Work-02-Paris-Review/dp/0140045414/ref=sr_1_12?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388182405&amp;sr=8-12&amp;keywords=Writers+at+work+george+plimpton">this set</a> edited by George Plimpton.&#0160; It has interviews with famous writers including T.S. Eliot, Henry Miller, and a rather grumpy Ernest Hemingway who didn’t really want to talk about his process.&#0160; But Hemingway did say that every writer needs a “a built-in shock-proof shit de­tector.” I love that. (Update: The<a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews" target="_self"> complete set </a>of the Paris Review interviews are online, spanning from the 1950&#39;s to the 2010&#39;s. I have been reading through them this morning. &#0160;I especially like <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/4867/the-art-of-fiction-no-17-truman-capote" target="_self">Truman Capote</a> from 1957 and <a href="http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6089/the-art-of-fiction-no-211-william-gibson" target="_self">William Gibson</a> from 2011, but I have a couple hundred left to read)</p>
<p>I am also fond of Stephen King’s amazing if disjointed <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-10th-Anniversary-Memoir-Craft/dp/1439156816/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1388099363&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=On+writing"><em>On Writing</em></a><em>,</em> I resonated with his motivation for writing this book about how he practices his craft – that he wanted people to understand that his day job was “about the language.” &#0160;Along these lines,I don’t think that Huggy was quite prepared for the perhaps 1000 conversations that I initiated about the words we used and how our sentences sounded during our seven year scaling project. &#0160;I was also astounded to learn that, for big hunk of Stephen King’s career, he consumed huge amounts of beer and (later) cocaine as he wrote (he was drinking a case – 24 cans – of 16oz tallboys a day before he went on the wagon in the late 1980s). &#0160;He wrote <em>The Shining </em>and<em> Misery</em> when he was totally wasted (not just drunk – some days he had cotton swabs jammed in his nose to stop the bleeding from all the cocaine abuse – but he kept typing). &#0160;</p>
<p>The business book world is a bit weird because, well, lots of people produce best sellers who don’t spend their days writing.&#0160; There are a lot of ghost writers out there – much of what you read under the bylines of CEOs, consultants, and management gurus are written by others. Sometimes the writers are listed as authors and other times they are not. &#0160;The first time I did an<em> HBR</em> article, back in about 1998, our editor Suzy Wetlaufer (now Welch, she married Jack) asked me “are you the author, the writer, or both?” I was dumbfounded by the question, but I have since learned that “writers” play an important and usually honorable role in spreading ideas about leadership, innovation, and so on.&#0160; I have also learned that some great books are produced when a person with great ideas has a mind meld with a great professional writer (as happened with <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2013/11/creativityinc-by-pixars-ed-catmull-one-of-the-best-business-books-of-all-time.html"><em>Creativity Inc.</em></a>)</p>
<p>&#0160;But this post is about and for people like me who are writers, or aspire to be, by Steve Barley’s definition. &#0160;Writing is such a quirky and individualistic process that what works for me probably won’t work for you, but here are some of the lessons that the process of getting the scaling book done reinforced for me:</p>
<p>1. I go through periods where I fret and suffer over what I am going to write – I can’t write anything that meets my standards without first going such periods of purgatory. &#0160;This fretting time is in addition to the research and reading that I do.&#0160; I often can’t tell the difference between when I am procrastinating and when I my brain is working out what to do next – the main indication is, usually quite suddenly, I shift gears from being unable to write to being able to produce sentences and paragraphs. &#0160;This process isn’t necessary for everyone. &#0160;My co-author Jeff Pfeffer’s ability to just blast things out amazes me, for example.&#0160;&#0160; For me, as I get closer to being able to write something, I start seeing the flow in my mind’s eye and start hearing the words I am going to write in my head.&#0160;&#0160; For a short piece, such as this blog post, the fretting might go on for an hour or less, for the book, I spent months (and many long bike rides) trying to think of the structure, and especially the language for the book proposal – which was quite detailed (22,000 words) and then I went through another few months of such fretting before I could really start writing the book.&#0160; &#0160;And before I started work on each chapter, I usually had to go through about a week of this discomfort. Yes, I would talk to Huggy pretty much every day, we would meet and brainstorm, we would do interviews, talk to colleagues, and read research – but the fretting was somehow different.</p>
<p>2.&#0160; Once I am able to produce text, <strong>my productivity is a direct function of how much time I spend at the keyboard MINUS the amount of time I spend poking around the web – emails, shopping, social media, reading news stories and weird articles, &#0160;and all that other necessary stuff and addictive nonsense</strong>.&#0160; Most of my lessons are pretty idiosyncratic, but my experience with doctoral students, faculty, and now people who aspire to write more for more applied audiences suggests that this lesson is universal. Talking about writing isn’t writing. Sitting in front of the screen and intending to write, but doing 10 hours of emails instead (I have had plenty of days like that), or shopping for a new dress or a new car don’t count. Nor does Facebook or Twitter.</p>
<p>3. One of my favorite lines in the <em>Paris Review</em> from comes from Aldous Huxley: &quot;All my thoughts are second thoughts.&quot; &#0160;As I’ve confessed on this blog before, all my thoughts are third, fourth, and fifth thoughts.&#0160;I spend at least 50% of my productive time reading and editing drafts I already have.&#0160; When I am working a chapter, I start at the beginning and read and edit almost every day before getting to the new text (even though that is usually what I have been fretting over).&#0160; When a chapter is done, I put it aside for a couple days, and then go back and edit it again before showing it to anyone.&#0160;</p>
<p>4. I edit by ear, as I have heard it called. I know that many writers have better writing styles. But I am not happy – and I feel fake – when something I write sounds like someone else. &#0160;Especially in my books, there is a tone, a voice, I try to maintain throughout that sounds like --- I hope – how I talk, but is smarter and more organized. Bascially, for me, listening to the voice I hear in my head and trying to get it to sound just right to my ear is the backbone of my writing process. &#0160;(Also, each of my books has a somewhat different voice – <em>Scaling Up Excellence</em> is less edgy than <em>The No Asshole Rule</em>).</p>
<p>I am VERY protective of my writing voice.&#0160; I reject many many changes from editors and copyeditors that undermine it (in my biased opinion). &#0160;And while most of what I write is grammatically correct, I will break rules when necessary. I have had some mighty good editors over the years – Julia Kirby at <em>HBR</em> is probably the best (she has never done a book of mine, only articles), and Rick Wolff who did <em>The No Asshole Rule</em> and <em>Good Boss, Bad Boss</em>, as well as Roger Scholl who did <em>Scaling Up Excellence,</em> are both skilled editors and get my voice obsession.</p>
<p>As an author, you’ve got to be careful because, at every stage, there are editors and others who mean well, but stamp out your spirit and make your words sound dull (For one of my books, I had an awful copyeditor who would have ruined the book – I rejected over 90% of her changes).&#0160; Here, I have a suggestion for authors that most publishers won’t like, but if they were smart, they would do it routinely.&#0160; Right before your book goes to the&#0160;copyediting stage, insist on having a conversation with your copyeditor and explain what you are trying to accomplish, and listen to his or perspective too.&#0160; And insist on seeing the editing in the first chapter after it is done. That way, you and the copyeditor won’t waste a lot of work.&#0160; (Note I feel so strongly about this that I am going to start putting it in as a requirement in book contracts – copyeditors are crucial to the quality of a book, but they also are strong willed people who can kill your voice).</p>
<p>In general, my experience is that about 50% of the editing (of any kind) I have had makes things better and 50% makes things worse. So my attitude is that, at every stage, you need to be vigilant about people who will screw up your work, as the risk always lurks. &#0160;(Warning: titles are often the worst. &#0160;I can’t tell you how many articles and blog posts I have had re-titled by people who clearly didn’t read them or twisted the meaning massively.&#0160; Ask for approval of any title of anything you write.&#0160; A lot of publications won’t like that either – but it has your name on it).</p>
<p>5.&#0160; As suggested above, I am obsessed with words. I am always looking for interesting words and phrases, and always trying to eliminate language that strike me as hollow or mind-numbing. Consider “adding value” and “capabilities.”&#0160; I don’t know why, but as soon as I hear someone say those words or I read them, I glaze over. I never use them.&#0160; I was soured on “adding value” at the World Economic Forum at Davos a few years back. I noticed that CEOs used it to avoid specifics or human emotions, and sometimes, as code for “as long as we make a lot of money, it does not matter how many evil things we do.&quot; &#0160;And I don’t like the word “capabilities” because it often seems to be used by executives and experts who are talking about the skills, motivations, and experience held by the people in an organization – while, at the same time, as way to avoid digging into the nuances and messiness of how those people actually propel the organization forward.&#0160;</p>
<p>I have kept a running list of words and phrases called “Words I Like” since about 2000. I add something about once a week. It has 795 words right now (fewer entries, as many are phrases), which range from “mangle,” to “trapped in a perpetual present tense,” to “pizzaz,” to “poisonous protection,” to “ruckus,” to “satisfying triple whammy.”&#0160; The challenge – and what I strive for as I edit by ear – is to use interesting words that sound like me, but do not to distract or confuse the reader.&#0160; (I dislike how publications like the <em>New Yorker </em>sometimes seem to use words, phrases, and obscure references that seem designed to make their readers feel dumb.) &#0160;I also admit that I love and use some words too much, such as “propel,” “incite,” and “infect.”&#0160;&#0160; I usually have to go back through and cross out about 50% of these and other darlings because they get repetitive (a skilled editor like Roger Scholl notices and saves me from myself).&#0160;</p>
<p>6.&#0160; Finally, and somewhat paradoxically, the longer that Huggy and I worked on <em>Scaling Up Excellence</em>, the more of a social process the writing became.&#0160; Not just between the two of us. But especially between us and the long and diverse list of people we worked with who were knee-deep in scaling challenges.&#0160; That is why the Appendix is called “The Seven Year Conversation.”&#0160; Getting the flow, language, and logic right required the above writing process.&#0160; But we wove in additional steps to get the stories right -- to help assure both the facts, advice, and emotional tone rang true to people who are knee-deep in scaling challenges.&#0160;</p>
<p>We constantly sent short snippets and long sections that we wrote to the stars of the book for their review and comments. &#0160;We are &#0160;grateful for how patient (and smart) these scaling veterans were -- including Claudia Kotchka (who led the spread of innovation practices and roles at Procter &amp; Gamble), Bonny Simi (JetBlue), John Lilly (now a venture capitalist at Greylock), Perry Klehbahn (head of executive ed at the Stanford d. School), Dr. Louise Liang (who led an amazing scaling effort at Kaiser Permanente as they rolled out their computerized patient record system), Michael Dearing (a venture capitalist and d.school teacher), Chris Fry and Steve Green (who did impressive scaling at Salesforce.com and now are senior execs at Twitter), and many many others. &#0160;We also presented our emerging ideas and key stories to at least 100 diverse audiences -- and refined the content and emphasis of the book based on what seemed interesting (and dull) to them. &#0160;We did use other sources – academic research, press reports, and our own observations and experiences – that did not require such interactions.&#0160; But <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385347022/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>Scaling Up Excellence</em></a>&#0160;is the product of a decidedly “social” approach -- even though it required thousands of hours of solo work.</p>
<p>Again, I am not sure that the above six ideas reflect how other writers work or will help others with their writing. Although I am pretty confident that my second point is universal, that writing productivity is a direct function of the amount of time that you actually spend writing (Stephen King might have been drunk and stoned when he was writing <em>Misery</em>, but he kept on working away at the manuscript).</p>
<p>I would be curious to hear about your writing process from those readers who practice this or a related craft. &#0160;More broadly, I am curious to hear about the kinds of workplace and business writing that appeals to you (and the kinds that you can’t stand).</p>
<p>Finally, to return to Steve Barley’s “you are what you do,” I was simply unable to write anything but emails for about six weeks after our book was done and copyedited in early fall.&#0160; But now – today is a good example– I seem to be back to myself and am spending a lot of time writing. &#0160;So look for more blog posts here, at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/influencer/15893932-Bob-Sutton?goback=%2Empd2_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_20131216160520*515893932*5management*5vs*5leadership*5a*5dangerous*5but*5accurate*5distinction&amp;trk=mp-details-header-postcount">LinkedIIn</a>, <a href="https://blogs.hbr.org/bob-sutton/">HBR</a>, and elsewhere.&#0160; We are also working on articles for various outlets -- I just did one for <em>Wired UK</em> that was fun, and we have multiple ideas for tying the ideas in <em>Scaling Up Excellence</em> to current news stories.&#0160;</p>
<p>If you have suggestions about scaling stories we should know about or scaling themes we should write about, please let us know your thoughts.&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e2019b025eecb0970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Greg&#39;s Cover" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e2019b025eecb0970c img-responsive" src="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e2019b025eecb0970c-800wi" title="Greg&#39;s Cover" /></a><br />Greg McKeown&#39;s publisher sent me an advanced copy of his book<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804137382/bobsutton-20" target="_self"> Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less</a>. &#0160;I said I would look at for a possible blurb (I don&#39;t do advanced praise for a lot of books, in part, because I now insist on reading the whole thing before I do -- and it takes time). &#0160;I was ready to NOT be impressed, as there are frankly lots of books out there about the power of simplicity. &#0160;But Greg goes beyond what I have seen from any other book with a similar message (although I am a big fan of Matt May&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071795618/bobsutton-20" target="_self">The Laws of Subtraction</a> as well, but that is a different book as it has many short essays, but still has a unified writing and great writing and editing -- in fact Matt&#39;s book and Greg&#39;s would be a good pair to read together). &#0160;</p>
<p>Through Greg&#39;s great message, his lovely spare writing style, and by gently leading the reader through his philosophy&#0160;he shows you what it &quot;disciplined&quot; approach means, looks like, and how to &quot;be it&quot; not just know how to define it &#0160;(I loved &quot;the perks of being unavailable,&quot; &quot;win big by cutting your losses,&quot; and &quot; &quot;select: the power of extreme criteria&quot; in particular).</p>
<p>&#0160;</p>
<p>I was especially interested once I got into the book because one of the major themes of<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385347022/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em> Scaling Up Excellence</em></a> is that, as although much research shows that we we human beings get dumber, loss will powers, and do each task less well as cognitive load increases, the necessary practices, structures, and rituals that organizations use often make it difficult or impossible for people to perform well (especially as organizations and programs expand). &#0160;We do touch on some simlar themes to Greg (we are both big advocates of sleep and taking &#0160;breaks!), but we focus more on approaches for redesigning jobs, teams, and organizations, and our focus zeros in on scaling. &#0160;</p>
<p>Essentialism&#0160;is a quick and efficient read, as you would expect given the title, but you learn a lot, and there is something about the book that led me to believe that, despite my general inability to use the word &quot;no&quot; more often than I should for my own good, that this book will help. &#0160;Although I couldn&#39;t quite resist reading the book, doing the blurb, and writing this little post!&#0160;</p>
<p>My blurb:</p>
<p>“Essentialism is a powerful antidote to the current craziness that plagues our organizations and our lives.&#0160; Read Greg McKeown’s words slowly, stop and think about how to apply them to your life – you will do less, do it better, and begin to feel the insanity start to slip away.”&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e2019b01bc8a08970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="CG_RS_4416W1_lowres" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e2019b01bc8a08970c image-full img-responsive" src="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e2019b01bc8a08970c-800wi" title="CG_RS_4416W1_lowres" /></a></p>
<p>During the seven years that Huggy Rao and I worked on&#0160;<em><a href="http://scalingupexcellence.com/" target="_blank">Scaling Up Excellence</a></em>, we got involved in some pretty unusual situations – at least for two rather staid old professors. We did everything from working with a company that was trying to improve the (terrible) customer experience in their chain of budget gas stations (I guess things were supposed to get better through magic, as they rejected any suggestion that took time or money) to the incredibly time-consuming but strangely satisfying process we went through to get a book cover design that we liked (that is fodder for another post – we went through many, many prototypes).</p>
<p>The sequence produced in the above picture was among the most amusing and (I confess) mot diagnostic of how difficult and picky I can be to work with AND how gracious, patient, and curious Huggy was and remains. My compulsiveness is, I think, often helpful when writing a book, as the process requires numerous iterations and constant editing. One of my favorite lines about writing comes from Aldous Huxley: &quot;All my thoughts are second thoughts.&quot; That is me. &#0160;Or, more precisely, all my thoughts are third, fourth, and fifth thoughts. I revise text so much that this compulsion led to some admittedly absurd situations. I don’t think that Huggy fully understood why he had to call me from Iceland to spend 30 minutes talking about two sentences in the draft that I didn&#39;t like, but he did so with good humor and as usual made inspired suggestions.</p>
<p>To return to the pictures, we already had plenty of photos of the two of us, but given how I am about pretty much everything, I insisted that we not settle for something easy or second rate or boring, that we do something interesting for the jacket photo. I immediately thought of<a href="http://www.claudiagoetzelmann.com/" target="_blank">Claudia Goetzelmann</a>, who, some seven years earlier, when I first started my blog&#0160;<a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Work Matters</a>, took that weird and wonderful picture of me next to that “thinker” statue at The&#0160;<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~mjpeters/png/" target="_blank">New Guinea Sculpture Garden at Stanford</a>&#0160;that has been at the top of this blog since the I first started (thanks to Diego Rodriguez of<a href="http://metacool.com/" target="_self"> Metacool</a> fame.) That crazy first above&#0160;was all Claudia’s idea. Once she saw that statue, something went off in her brain and she took picture after picture of me in various odd poses with that statue.</p>
<p>This time, Claudia asked if, before she took the pictures, if she could scout out nearby locations. We wrongly assumed the location would actually be on the Stanford campus and would be be something rather traditional and academic – standing in front of books, teaching a room full of students, or perhaps a shot of us in serious scholarly conversation. That is not quite how Claudia’s mind works. She decided, after driving around for several hours, that the best light in the afternoon was next to the&#0160;<a href="http://bata.mtc.ca.gov/bridges/dumbarton.htm" target="_blank">Dumbarton Bridge</a>&#0160;that connects the lower San Francisco Peninsula to the East Bay – a pretty weird location, we thought, as it was a good 20 minutes from Stanford – there were no academic trappings, just a grassy sandy marsh, the bay, and a big bridge packed with noisy smelly traffic. (Indeed, see Diego&#39;s<a href="http://metacool.com/why-your-creative-culture-needs-a-few-kooks-and-spoon-benders/" target="_self"> latest post</a>. Claudia is a spoon bender of the best kind).&#0160;</p>
<p>Claudia also wrote and asked if she could spend 30 bucks on two picture frames as she thought that they would make for an interesting picture. I thought she was nuts, The idea of jamming our heads together in a frame did not seem becoming of two serious scholars like us, but I did not want to interfere with the creative process. When we saw them, we started laughing. Then we really started giggling when we saw that Claudia had hired a make-up artist to “touch you up.” It didn’t seem to us as if make-up would help us look any younger or prettier. But we remembered Richard Nixon shiny head and sweaty lip fiasco after he refused make-up when he debated John Kennedy on TV in the 1960s, so we both agreed to accept a bit of powder and lip goo of some kind.</p>
<p>Claudia was so energetic and encouraging that the experience was really fun. I think we had been laughing nonstop for an hour by the time she took the above picture – her favorite after taking perhaps 1000 pictures of us in various poses (at least 100 with us actually standing up against the bridge wall). When we arrived, we were in coats and ties – Claudia humored us and took some pictures, but soon had us remove them because they made us look too boring.</p>
<p>As a result of Claudia’s imagination, skill, and infectious enthusiasm, the book jacket will have a picture we love. I doubt it will help sell any books. It might even drive people away who decide that two guys in a crooked picture frame (and who look like they are about to dissolve into laughter) couldn&#39;t possibly write a rigorous and relevant book on scaling or any other business topic. But, for us, the picture feels right because it symbolizes so much about the seven year “adventure” that led to&#0160;<em><a href="http://scalingupexcellence.com/" target="_blank">Scaling Up Excellence</a></em>. We both were willing to try something weird that made us a bit uncomfortable, I pushed for a compulsive, time consuming, and arguably unnecessary solution that required trying a lot of ideas and throwing most away, Huggy was patient and bemused throughout (even when most sane people would tell me to bug off), and we had good fun.</p>
<p>So that is how we ended up with that crazy picture. We hope you like it.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Phyllis Korkki of the <em>New York Times</em> wrote a piece this Sunday for her Workstation column called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/jobs/invasion-of-the-annual-reviews.html?ref=todayspaper&amp;_r=0" target="_self">Invasion of the Annual Reviews.</a>&#0160; It emphasizes the risks and downsides of annual reviews, and she quotes me quite a bit -- I didn&#39;t realize how much until the piece came out. &#0160;But she got it right, as she always does (I have worked with her before, she is very professional and very careful). &#0160;As Phyllis had only so many words to work with, and she weaves in the perspectives of others including an interesting clarifying statement from a Yahoo! spokesperson asserting they are not doing forced ranking, but rather &quot;“Our system lets employees understand how they are performing relative to expectations (exceeding, achieving or missing), and there are no hard and fast rules.”&#0160;</p>
<p>I got a couple emails from friends -- one congratulatory and the other that disagreed with me -- suggesting that the piece meant I was opposed to all annual performance reviews, not just bad performance reviews. &#0160;I confess that I have raised the question of if they should be abolished <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2008/02/perfromnce-eval.html" target="_self">before </a>and&#0160;two parts of the piece may have helped to fuel this impression:</p>
<p>This paraphrase from Phyllis:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Professor Sutton is wary of rankings and yearly evaluations in general. Many organizations, he said, would be better off if they provided continuous feedback, with formal evaluations coming into play mainly if a worker is being eyed for promotion or has shown substandard performance.</p>
<p>And the closing paragraph:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“If performance evaluations were a drug, they would not receive F.D.A. approval,” he said, because “they have so many side effects, and so often they fail.”</p>
<p>These are accurate representations of my perspective. &#0160;But I think it is important to make clear that I am not opposed to all performance evaluations, only bad ones. -- and unfortunately, they are done badly more often then they are done well. &#0160;So, what are the hallmarks of good performance evaluations? &#0160;Consider three:</p>
<p>1. Is what happens during that annual conversation and evaluation woven into the fabric of every day life, or as I was quoted in the piece &quot;“this weird form you fill out every year that has nothing to do with everyday life.” &#0160;So if your boss gives you positive feedback all year, or doesn&#39;t give you feedback at all over the course of the year, and then you get bad review, the boss isn&#39;t doing his or her job. &#0160;In organizations that generally do evaluations well, I think of McKinsey and GE, although they do yearly evaluations, there is also an emphasis on teaching and nudging leaders to constantly give their direct reports regular coaching and feedback. &#0160;There are two tests here.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">If you are a boss, do people often seem surprised by the feedback you give them during annual reviews?</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Does the review conversation seem uncomfortable and unnatural, something that bears no relationship between the feedback and coaching (or lack of it) that happens throughout the year.&#0160;</p>
<p>2. How is excellent performance defined and measured? &#0160;In some firms, even though the goal is to create collaboration and information sharing, &quot;stars&quot; are nonetheless anointed solely on the basis of individual achievements (and for more senior folks, on the basis of their team of department&#39;s contribution, not on their contribution to the overall success of the organization). &#0160;In too many companies, although leaders hope for cooperation, they reward backstabbing, stomping on others on the way to the top, and other flavors of dysfunctional internal competition. &#0160;So the question of &quot;who is a superstar here&quot; is the one I ask leaders all the time, I want to know &quot;are they the people who are great individual performers AND who help others succeed -- or are the people that ignore and even undermine their colleagues?&quot; &#0160;This is a theme that Jeff Pfeffer and I wrote about in our books on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578511240/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>The Knowing-Doing Gap</em></a> and<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591398622/bobsutton-20" target="_self"> <em>Hard Facts</em></a>, and I revisit in<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446556076/bobsutton-20" target="_self"> <em>Good Boss, Bad Boss</em>.</a>&#0160;Note also that both GE and McKinsey are usually very careful to anoint the right kind of stars -- and so are a lot of other organizations I admire including IDEO, P&amp;G, and the Cleveland Clinic.&#0160;</p>
<p>3. Finally, while I believe strongly in weeding out bad apples and rewarding good behavior, what are the assumptions about the nature of a human organization? &#0160;Do leaders believe that there will always be a certain percentage of losers who will need to be weeded out and a certain percentage of amazing performers who deserve the lion&#39;s share of rewards. &#0160;This is the assumption that drives many stack ranking and one I don&#39;t like and that is contrary to the evidence. &#0160;It is also contrary to the logic of the quality movement (which weirdly, GE who at least had this system in the past embraced as well). &#0160;Imagine a manufacturing system or worse yet a hospital where you assumed that year over that there would be a 10% defect rate, 70% of the work would only be OK, and only 20% would be great. &#0160;Unfortunately, that is the implication of how stack ranking is done in some places, even other wise very well managed places. &#0160;</p>
<p>Here is how things can play out when this assumption is implemented in a misguided way. &#0160;One senior executive I know had spent years building a great 12 person team. &#0160;He hired carefully, he weeded out a few rotten apples, and has the team humming. &#0160;Then, the company hired a head of HR who had unwavering faith in firing the bottom 10% each year -- he was required to fire one of his people. &#0160;In essence, following the logic of Deming and other quality gurus, he had built a system with no defective parts -- but was required to throw one away. &#0160;He refused to do it and quit -- which, as he told them, solved their problem, because now they didn&#39;t have to fire a member of his team (which they did anyway, as he &quot;didn&#39;t count.&quot;)&#0160;</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies my views. &#0160;Note that the NYT&#39;s piece also talks a bit about Adobe&#39;s recent efforts to abolish annual reviews and replace them with frequent check-ins. &#0160;Huggy Rao and had in-depth conversations with Donna Morris, the brave executive who led this change, and we talk about the details in our forthcoming book<a href="http://scalingupexcellence.com/" target="_self"><em> Scaling Up Excellence. </em></a>&#0160;The upshot is that Donna and her colleagues worked on shifting the focus from the mechanics of annual reviews to the nuances of daily interactions between leaders and their teams.</p>
<p>I am quite interested in the path that Adobe is taking because the result may be that, indeed, there is a better alternative to yearly performance evaluations. &#0160;Indeed, note that, in the places that do them well, they are woven into the fabric of everyday life -- so perhaps an interesting test of how bad &#0160;AND how good your annual performance evaluation is &quot;what would happen if we didn&#39;t do them?&quot; &#0160;Oddly, if you are doing them really badly, then I would argue that doing nothing might be better. &#0160;Just give employees an envelope with their yearly raise and skip that stilted dysfunctional disingenuous yearly conversation. &#0160;And if you are doing things really well, then perhaps you will find out that you don&#39;t need them after all because people&#0160;are getting such regular feedback and coaching that the formalities are a waster of time in most cases-- think of all the time and money you would save!&#0160;</p>

				<p><a class="asset-img-link" href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e2019b018a58c6970b-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="71+BorRuP4L._SL1500_" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e2019b018a58c6970b image-full img-responsive" src="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e2019b018a58c6970b-800wi" title="71+BorRuP4L._SL1500_" /></a></p>
<p>Ed Catmull has been one of my favorite senior executives for a long time. &#0160;I admired him from afar after reading about him in David Price&#39;s excellent <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307265757/bobsutton-20" target="_self">The Pixar Touch</a>. &#0160;I admired him even more after talking to people at Pixar about what it was like to work with him (see <a href="https://blogs.hbr.org/2011/01/pixar-lore-the-day-our-bosses/" target="_self">this story</a>). And then I got to him a little through several interactions I had with him as part of authors&#39; group here in the San Francisco area and also, when Huggy Rao and I interviewed him for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385347022/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>Scaling Up Excellence</em></a>. &#0160;</p>
<p>The most interesting, and I think revealing, interactions I have had with Ed, however, have not been in person -- they have come from the process of reading and commenting on an earlier draft of his book, and exchanging emails with him. &#0160;And, most recently, reading the finished product. &#0160;I won&#39;t go through all the twists and turns of the process, but Ed (and obviously his co-writer Amy Wallace, who I did not interact with directly) clearly were dedicated to getting it right, &#0160;Even in that early draft, the astounding and intertwined stories of Ed&#39;s life and Pixar&#39;s development into one of greatest companies on the planet were riveting, as were his insights about building a creative company that run throughout the book. But, as Ed and his Pixar colleagues do, he wasn&#39;t just satisfied with just a good book, he took the time and effort, and went through one difficult iteration after another, to make a book that just sings. &#0160;You will have trouble putting it down once you pick it up. &#0160;And while it may seem like it just rolled out with ease, as with most great things, Ed and Amy wouldn&#39;t let it go until it was right.&#0160;</p>
<p>It was privilege to get a few glimpses of how Ed&#39;s mind works during the process, especially over the Christmas-New Years break last year when I read the book closely and gave Ed several rounds of comments (I would read a few chapters, and then send him another note). My favorite exchange came at one juncture, after reading the section where Ed describes the sequence of events where he, Steve Jobs, and others were involved in selling Pixar to Disney and announcing it to his people in Emeryville, where Pixar is located and those wonderful movies are made.</p>
<p>&#0160;It was pretty deep into the book. &#0160;And I finally realized that it had a problem I had never seen in any book written by a successful executive, as I put it to Ed &quot;not enough narcissism.&quot; &#0160;There wasn&#39;t ENOUGH information about the influence he was having, the words he was saying, or about how he turned&#0160;his considerable wisdom&#0160;into action. There was plenty about other people, folks like Steve Jobs and John Lasseter that reflected his keep empathy and observational powers. &#0160;As I read the final version, I saw that Ed perspective and influence is emphasized just enough for my tastes now -- although his trademark modesty persists.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812993012/bobsutton-20" target="_self">The book </a>isn&#39;t out to until April. &#0160;But you should pre-order it now, you will want to read it right away. Here is my blurb -- I hope you love this book (and admire Ed&#39;s smarts, values, and accomplishments) as much as I did:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">“This is the best book ever written on what it takes to build a creative organization. It is the best because Catmull’s wisdom, modesty, and self-awareness fill every page. He shows how Pixar’s greatness results from connecting the specific little things they do (mostly things that anyone can do in any organization) to the big goal that drives everyone in the company: making films that make them feel proud of one another.&quot;</p>
<p>P.S. Note that I have revised my list of <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/11/11-books-every-boss-should-own.html" target="_self">books that every leader should read</a> to include <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812993012/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>Creativity, Inc.</em></a></p>
<p>P.P.S. When I wrote to Ed how much &#0160;I liked the cover, he said something like &quot;well, we have some pretty good artists here.&quot; No kidding. Isn&#39;t it beautiful?&#0160;</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>This is reprinted from the Harvard Business Review site. A big thanks to Julia Kirby for the wonderful editing.</em></p>
<p>Start talking about the challenge of “scaling” with people, and you’ll find the term gets used to mean a lot of different things. For example, when entrepreneurs talk about it, they are usually struggling with matters of organization. Take <a href="https://wwws.citruslane.com/#index">Citrus Lane</a> CEO Mauria Finley, whose company was experiencing some growing pains, appropriately enough; the startup sends monthly packages of great baby products to moms. After raising $5.1 million in capital in 2012, it grew from 6 to 20 employees.</p>
<p>Back in 2011, in Citrus Lane’s first six months, its small founding team worked in a house and ate lunch together every day around a big table. Any problem or opportunity that arose was dealt with right then and there, lest misunderstandings fester or business prospects slip away. Growing to 20 people working in a more traditional office setting did not strike anyone as extreme change, yet the team found it had to work a lot harder to unearth problems and opportunities. Even more tricky, they had to learn to articulate something that had been tacit: a shared understanding of goals, culture, and what it takes to succeed at Citrus Lane. Today, they constantly remind each other to spend time with newcomers and, as Finley emphasized, not just tell them these things when they are hired or remind them a few times. The scaled-up organization needs to hear about what matters most at Citrus Lane over and over, to live these beliefs every day, and to observe her and other leaders living them, as well. Deliberate effort is required because “it isn’t something that just happens naturally at lunch every day any longer. We are too big now.”</p>
<p>A growing employee base represents one type of scaling challenge. Since my Stanford colleague Huggy Rao and I decided several years ago to study scaling (it’s the topic of our forthcoming book <a href="http://scalingupexcellence.com/"><em>Scaling Up Excellence</em></a>), we have heard about many others – so many that we thought, early on, that we might need to put a finer point on which form we hoped to shed light on.</p>
<p>For example, when leaders of much larger organizations talk about scaling, they’re often talking about something more akin to replication. In a 2001 interview with HBR, UPS’s then CEO Jim Kelly described the growth of the company: “For decades, we’ve been able to grow tremendously simply by expanding our core business geographically. Really, UPS’s first 75 years was spent expanding across the United States: first to 13 states, then to nine additional states, and so forth. We just took our core delivery business and applied for rights in different states.” Today that kind of marketplace scaling often means a more complicated process of global expansion– such as IKEA’s opening stores in China, or Home Depot’s failed efforts to do so.</p>
<p>And then there are the organizational leaders who use the term scaling to describe their desire to find pockets of excellence in behaviors and beliefs in the organization and spread them further – a different challenge than adding new people and locations. We studied how Wyeth, the large Pharmaceutical firm (now part of Pfizer) made dramatic improvements in cost and quality across its manufacturing operation. It first created pockets of excellence in a few small teams in each of eight plants (calling them “mini-transformations”) and then relied on mentoring and coaching to spread the superior practices throughout each plant, from one team to the next.</p>
<p>Still another variation on scaling is when better practices are transferred across networks of organizations. Between 2004 and 2006, for example, a Boston-based nonprofit called the <a href="http://www.ihi.org/Pages/default.aspx">Institute for Health Improvement</a> led an effort called the “100,000 Lives Campaign” to raise awareness in U.S. hospitals of the importance of some simple practices (e.g., more frequent and thorough hand-washing) in reducing infection rates. Ultimately, some 3200 hospitals comprising over 70% of U.S. beds participated in the Campaign. There is compelling evidence (including analysis done by members of a Stanford doctoral seminar that Huggy Rao ran about five years ago) that the number of preventable deaths in U.S dropped by about 120,000 during this period. (Other factors probably contributed to that decrease, but the Campaign clearly played a large role.)</p>
<p>In each of these situations, “scaling” refers to something different. But as we dug deeper into these and other cases, academic studies, and stories, we realized what they shared. Scaling challenges nearly always come down to the same problem: the difficulty of spreading something good from those who have it to those that don’t – or at least don’t yet. It is always, in other words, the <em>problem of more.</em></p>
<p>Finley and her team face the problem of more – and the success of her growing organization depends on solving it. The need for more of what was working well also challenged Wyeth, IKEA, and the Institute for Health Improvement. Have their successful efforts come from the same mold in terms of what they are spreading and by what method? No – and yet, we are finding a great deal of commonality in the obstacles that arise and the decisions that must be made. We’ve discovered guiding principles that turn out to apply as other leaders and teams go about building and uncovering pockets of exemplary performance, and spreading those splendid deeds.</p>
<p>Sometimes the way to learn more about a subject is to focus in more tightly and become more precise in one’s use of language. But sometimes the challenge itself is big enough – like the basic problem of spreading something good to more people and places without screwing up – that it doesn’t help to narrow its definition. Sometimes, even with the use of a word, it’s better to scale it up</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva;">Stanford&#39;s <a href="http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/users/march" target="_self">James G. March</a> is arguably the most prestigious living organizational theorist. &#0160;We are reading his 1981 classic paper <a href="https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2392340?uid=3739560&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21102731219097" target="_self">&quot;Footnotes to Organizational Change&quot; </a>for my scaling up excellence doctoral class. There is one paragraph in this paper that is especially inspired, in the beautiful style of his, March is explaining (among other things) that what many people (including senior management) see as resistance and rigidity is actually proof of great flexibility and innovation -- but the resulting changes are often what any one group actors don&#39;t want or expect:&#0160;</span></p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva;"><strong style="font-size: 10pt;">W</strong></strong><strong style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva;"><strong style="font-size: 10pt;">hat</strong></strong><strong style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva;"><strong style="font-size: 10pt;"> </strong><strong style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva;">most reports on implementation indicate, however, is not that organizations ar</strong></strong><strong style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva;">e </strong><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva;">rigid and inflexible, but that they are impressively imaginative (Pressman and&#0160;Wildavsky, 1973; Bardach, 1977). Organizations change in response to their
environments, but they rarely change in a way that fulfills the intentions of a
particular group of actors (Attewell and Gerstein,1979; Crozier, 1979). Sometimes
organizations ignore clear instructions; sometimes they pursue them more
forcefully than was intended; sometimes they protect policymakers from folly;
sometimes they do not. The ability to frustrate arbitrary intention, however,
should not be confused with rigidity; nor should flexibility be confused with
organizational effectiveness…There is considerable stability in organizations,
but the changes we observe are substantial enough to suggest that organizations
are remarkably adaptive, enduring institutions, responding to volatile
environments routinely and easily, though not always optimally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva;"><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva;">There is so much wisdom -- and also so much underlying evidence packed into this statement -- that I am going to devote a long time to discussing it with my students later today! &#0160;My favorite line is &quot;sometimes they pursue them more forcefully then intended.&quot; I once studied a large convenience store chain that spent millions of dollars trying to increase courtesy after the CEO had a temper tantrum about bad service her received in a store -- he was pretty shocked when he learned how strongly the company responded, as they rolled out a far larger a program than he expected, wanted, or believed would be useful!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva;"><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva;"> I&#39;ve always been interested in situations like this where small signals from powerful people result in much stronger reactions than they intend -- the opposite of resistance to change, if you will. &#0160; And in this case it led them to scale up a program that was much bigger, expensive, and time-consuming than he ever intended</span></span><span style="font-family: &#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, geneva; font-size: 10pt;">.&#0160;</span></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Earlier in the week, I did my first post at HBR.org in over 2.5 years -- my last was in January 2011. I was pretty shocked that it had been so long -- my last post was about a<a href="https://blogs.hbr.org/2011/01/pixar-lore-the-day-our-bosses/" target="_self"> story I heard</a> at Pixar on how Ed Catmull and Alvy Ray Smith (Pixar&#39;s founders) served as &quot;human shields.&quot; In the 1980s, they were under pressure from their (then superiors) at Lucasfilm to do a large layoff in the division that eventually was sold to Steve Jobs and became Pixar. Ed and Alvy did somthing remarkable to protect their people --something that people at Pixar still talk about to this day. </p>
<p>As the song goes, ain&#39;t it funny how time slips away.&#0160; But the last few years have required intense focus from Huggy Rao and me to finish <a href="http://scalingupexcellence.com/" target="_self"><em>Scaling Up Excellence</em></a>, as we both gave everything we had to the book -- it isn&#39;t up to us to judge the quality, but I can tell you that I worked longer and harder on this effort than any work project in my life. The last year or so, when people asked me what I was doing, I half-joked &quot;I am trying to type my way out of solitary confinement in my garage.&quot; </p>
<p>To be clear, although I am delighted to have the book finally done, and both Huggy and I sometimes felt pressure to make progress and were troubled when we hit dead ends, part of me is sorry the writing is over. Huggy is a delight to work with (his speed of idea generation is astounding) and, well, the fact is that I am probably happiest when I am alone in a quiet room writing.&#0160; So the book gave me a glorious excuse to indulge in something I love. Now, I will turn that love to writing short pieces about scaling and other management and realted behavioral science topics -- here and elsewhere. And<a href="http://faculty-gsb.stanford.edu/rao/" target="_self"> Huggy</a> is getting cranked up to do so as well -- he is a remarkably creative guy, one of the most productive, thoughtful, and prestigious organizational researchers on the planet. </p>
<p>I will reprint the HBR post here in a week or so -- they let me do that after it has been the site for awhile.&#0160; The new is called <a href="https://blogs.hbr.org/2013/10/scaling-the-problem-of-more/" target="_self">&quot;Scaling:The Problem of More.&quot;</a> Julia Kirby, a senior editor at HBR (and a skilled management theorist -- see <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1422131688/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>Standing on the Sun</em></a>) helped me craft a compact summary of how and why we ended-up with such a broad take on the concept of scaling and what it takes to do it well. Here is the key sentence:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&quot;Scaling challenges nearly always come down to the same problem: the 
difficulty of spreading something good from those who have it to those 
that don’t – or at least don’t yet. It is always, in other words, the <em>problem of more.&quot;</em></p>
<p>It sounds so simple when I re-read those words. But Huggy and I spent seven years wrestling with this challenge -- and we aren&#39;t done yet!&#0160; It would be arrogant -- and also not very useful -- to claim that we&#39;ve got all the answers just because the book is done.&#0160; As I will discuss in future posts, the book evolved from a process where Huggy and I believed that we would spend a few years gathering evidence, stories, and scaling techniques and then one day unveil the fully formed &quot;truth&quot;&#0160; in the book to a more social process.&#0160; Our writing was punctuated by interactions where we described parts of what we had learned to people who were knee-deep in scaling, had been in the past, or had other kinds of expertise related to scaling (especially our academic colleagues). Then we would listen to their reactions, stories, evidence, and advice -- and update our perspective little by little.&#0160; </p>
<p>Finishing the book is a milestone in this process, but as Huggy likes to say, &quot;the adventure continues.&quot;&#0160; So please give us your reactions, tell us your scaling stories, and ask us hard questions. As you will see here and elsewhere, we are continuing to collect new studies, stories, and lessons about what it takes to scale up without screwing up.<em> <br /></em></p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<small style="font-size: 10pt;"> </small>
<p>I was tried
to get this out over Twitter, but breaking it into pieces ruins it.&#0160; If
you want to read one of the most spot on, timeless, and funny books about organizational
politics, check out the F.M. Cornford&#39;s 1908 classic MICROCOSMOGRAPHIA
ACADEMICA: BEING&#0160;A&#0160;GUIDE&#0160;FOR&#0160;THE&#0160;YOUNG&#0160;ACADEMIC&#0160;POLITICIAN.&#0160;
You can get this short gem <a href="https://larvatus.livejournal.com/222591.html" target="_self">here</a> for free.</p>
<p>And here is
my favorite bit:</p>
<p>“The&#0160;<em>Principle of the Dangerous Precedent</em>&#0160;is that you should not now do an admittedly
right action for fear you, or your equally timid successors, should not have
the courage to do right in some future case, which,&#0160;<em>ex hypothesi</em>, is essentially different, but superficially resembles the
present one. Every public action which is not customary, either is wrong, or,
if it is right, is a dangerous precedent. It follows that nothing should ever
be done for the first time.”</p>
<p>It is amazing how over 100 years later, the same principle
is still applied far too often.&#0160; See Daniel Kahneman’s<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374275637/bobsutton-20"> book</a>
if you want to see some of the main reasons why – thinking is hard work! </p>
<p>P.S.&#0160; Cornford was a famous classicist at
Cambridge around the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.</p>

<p>Several months back, Scott Berkun&#39;s publisher sent me an advanced&#0160; copy of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1118660633/bobsutton-20" target="_self">&quot;The Year Without Pants&quot; </a>to read; it is a pretty silly title and as you can see, the cover is pretty wild too (I love it).&#0160; Scott&#39;s last book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Confessions-Public-Speaker-English/dp/1449301959/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377195196&amp;sr=1-1" target="_self">Confessions of a Public Speaker</a>, was just splendid, so I thought I would take a look.&#0160; I was hooked immediately, as Scott offers a compelling story of the year he spent at Wordpress.com, a fast growing and wildly unconventional company where employees work from wherever they wish, there are few meetings and rules, and many of the conventional trappings are removed.&#0160; At the same time, because Scott is such a compelling writer and so honest about things, he doesn&#39;t whitewash things, he describes the ups and downs and the tensions.&#0160;</p>
<p>And if you read this book, you will also learn that some of the beliefs that people have about the future of work likely won&#39;t come true.&#0160; Yes, people had enormous freedom and were massively creative -- but at the same time -- they couldn&#39;t escape the constraints of being in an organization.They still needed some hierarchy (Scott was a team leader and he had some bosses too), there were agreements about standard ways to do -- and not do -- things, and everyone wasn&#39;t always delighted with how things unfolded.&#0160; His team was unusually functional and creative, the descriptions are wonderful, and the book also is filled with great pictures and other graphics that show the real people and the places they worked, and the kind of work they produced. </p>
<p>I read, or more accurately, start to read, several business books each week.&#0160; Most aren&#39;t very good, to tell you the truth.&#0160; This is the best book I have read since Adam Grant&#39;s<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670026557/bobsutton-20" target="_self"> <em>Give and Take</em></a>. If you read this book and Tracy Kidder&#39;s classic<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Soul-New-Machine-Tracy-Kidder/dp/0316491977/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1377196570&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=soul+of+a+new+machine" target="_self"><em> Soul of a New Machine</em></a>, you can learn a lot about how work is changing (at least in some places), but also, about how it is still the same too. The technology certainly changes how and where we work, but we are still humans, we are social creatures, we strive for meaning and creativity, and we are all limited (and propelled) by our personal quirks and the attribuites of our species. </p>
<p>P.S. T<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1118660633/bobsutton-20" target="_self">he Year Without Pants</a> comes out in a few weeks, but I suggest that you preorder it, both because you will want it and because preorders will help this book get the attention it deserves. I am going to preorder my copy right now. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>A compelling and instructive <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-11/at-sears-eddie-lamperts-warring-divisions-model-adds-to-the-troubles" target="_self">story on Sears Holdings </a>appeared in<em> BusinessWeek</em> last month -- they own Sears stores, Kmart, Land&#39;s End and a host of other brands such as Craftsman tools, Kenmore appliances, and DieHard batteries.&#0160; It is written by Mina Kimes and provides a textbook example of how, when people in a company are pitted against each other -- rather than pressed and paid to support the greater good -- that cooperation evaporates. People treat insiders (rather than outsiders) as enemies.&#0160; And even when they know what needs to be done for the effectiveness of the organization as a whole, they often don&#39;t do it -- because helping others (or contributing to the greater good) undermines their income, stature, and job security. </p>
<p>Jeff Pfeffer and I wrote about this disease in some detail in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578511240/bobsutton-20" target="_self"><em>The Knowing Doing Gap</em></a> in 2000 and in related articles and posts based on the book, for example,<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/The-Enemy-Within-Internal-competition-saps-2774080.php" target="_self"> here</a>, <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/07/dysfunctional-internal-competition-at-microsoft-weve-seen-the-enemy-and-it-is-us.html" target="_self">here</a>, and <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/knowledgebase/cgi-bin/1999/11/15/the-perils-of-internal-competition/" target="_self">here</a>. It has been over a decade since we focused on this problem, but if anything, it has become worse in many companies -- as the Sears story shows.&#0160; Kimes&#39; detailed article provides many examples of the problems caused by the Sears structure and incentives, where CEO Eddie Lampert has split the company into some 30 warring units, each with &quot;its own president, chief marketing officer, board
 of directors, and, most important, its own profit-and-loss statement.&quot; </p>
<p>Lampert defends this structure as &quot;decentralized,&quot; but that confuses a structure where individual units have autonomy to act largely as the please with one where there is no incentive (or worse, a disincentive) to support the company&#39;s overall performance.&#0160; Google, for example, is quite decentralized, but there have always been both cultural and financial pressures to do what is best for the company as a whole.&#0160; Even within the famously competitive and decentralized General Electric, there have been incentives for cooperation for decades and selfish &quot;cowboys&quot; who don&#39;t support colleagues and the culture have been banished from the company.</p>
<p>In contrast, let&#39;s take a rather astounding example from the Sears story:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&quot;At the beginning of 2010, Lampert hired 20-year Wal-Mart Stores veteran Jim Haworth to run Sears and Kmart stores as president of 
retail services. Haworth, an affable, mustachioed Midwesterner, saw 
immediately that Kmart’s food and drugs were more expensive than those 
at Walmart and Target.
 So he met with a few top executives, including Chief Financial Officer 
Mike Collins and operations chief Scott Freidheim, to look into 
discounting goods such as milk and soda.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">That summer the group 
asked the company’s internal research team to study the idea, according 
to eight former executives. The researchers came back with a proposal: 
Cut prices at several dozen Kmarts across the country, bringing the cost
 of items to within 5&#0160;percent of Walmart’s. The business unit presidents
 agreed. But when Haworth’s group tried to get them to cough up 
$2&#0160;million to fund the project, no one was willing to sacrifice business
 operating profits to increase traffic.&quot;</p>
<p>The reason, according to the story, that no President was willing to cough up any funds was that cutting into their businesses operating profit would, in turn, reduce their bonuses.&#0160; The parent company refused to fund the effort as well and the key executives involved in pressing for the proposal are no longer with Sears. In short, it is a nearly perfect example of how -- even though everyone knows the right thing to do for the collective good -- no one does it because they live in zero-sum, I win and you lose, world. As the article shows, this mindset can create some mighty ugly scenes:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">&quot;The bloodiest battles took place in the marketing meetings, where 
different units sent their CMOs to fight for space in the weekly 
circular. These sessions would often degenerate into screaming matches. 
Marketing chiefs would argue to the point of exhaustion. The result, 
former executives say, was a “Frankenstein” circular with incoherent 
product combinations (think screwdrivers being advertised next to 
lingerie).&quot;</p>
<p>This me me me mindset might work in situations where there is no need for collaboration, information sharing, or even pooled resources.&#0160;&#0160;&#0160; But it doesn&#39;t work when people and units depend on each other to succeed.&#0160; </p>
<p>I also want to emphasize -- despite some suggestion from Lampert and others that cooperation is a form of evil socialism -- that many companies have cultures and incentives that generate both competition and collaboration simultaneously (to name five widely varied organizations, McKinsey, IDEO, General Electric, Procter &amp; Gamble, and the Men&#39;s Wearhouse all accomplish this one way or another). The trick is that star employees are defined (and trained, groomed, rewarded, and led) as those who do high quality individual work (or, for more senior people, lead top performing teams or businesses) AND who help colleagues (on their team, on different teams, and in different businesses) succeeded as well.&#0160; If you don&#39;t do both consistently, you aren&#39;t a star. In such places, the competitive pressures to HELP others and the 
ORGANIZATION are palpable: People compete against each other by trying 
to be MORE collaborative than their colleagues.&#0160; Its like a weird Jedi mind trick, but it works beautifully when done well. </p>
<p>While I am no fan of forced rankings (I don&#39;t believe that every organization must be doomed to have 10%&#0160; to 20% defective employees, for example), when people are evaluated, or even ranked, on this dual standard, organizations perform far better than when have you a situation such as at Sears where &quot;As the business unit leaders pursued individual profits, rivalries 
broke out. Former executives say they began to bring laptops with screen
 protectors to meetings so their colleagues couldn’t see what they were 
doing.&quot;&#0160; </p>
<p><strong>In short, when I want to know if an organization rewards or punishes cooperation, the diagnostic question I ask is &quot;Who are the superstars around here? Are they the selfish people who stomp on others on the way to the top? Or are they the people who do great work AND who use what they know to lend a helping hand to others?&quot;</strong> </p>
<p>P.S. The recent structural changes at Microsoft -- long infamous for its nasty internal competition -- provide an interesting counterpoint. They are not only becoming more centralized and streamlined ala Apple, as<em> The New York Times</em> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/technology/microsoft-revamps-structure-and-management.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0" target="_self">reports</a> &quot;The goal is to get thousands of employees to collaborate more closely, 
to avoid some duplication and, as a result, to build their products to 
work more harmoniously together.&quot; Microsoft has a long history and ingrained habits to overcome, but this strikes me as a step in the right direction. </p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>Please forgive my months of silence. &#0160;I appreciate all the folks who have asked if I am OK (I am fine!) and who have urged me to start blogging again. &#0160;You will start hearing more here about what I&#39;ve been doing the last six months. &#0160;The short story is that Huggy Rao and I have been working like crazy on <em>Scaling Up Excellence</em>, our book that will be published in early 2014. We just have a few finishing touches after putting seven years or so into this project. Then I will start talking about it -- this book has been quite an adventure and we are already talking to a lot of different groups about the main ideas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was moved to do a post because, as we have written the book, one of the themes that has moved center stage, and I&#39;ve <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/08/felt-accountability-some-emerging-thoughts.html" target="_self">blogged about before,</a> is accountability: How it is a hallmark of organizations that spread and sustain excellence (and its absence of a hallmark of bad ones). &#0160;This problem was especially evident in&#0160;<a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/08/united-airlines-lost-my-friends-10-year-old-daughter-and-didnt-care.html" target="_self">United Airlines&#39; poor treatment</a> of my friend&#39;s young daughter last summer. &#0160;As counterpoint, a friend sent me this note of apology he got from Delta. Note I have removed his name and account number. &#0160;Obviously, airlines can&#39;t control things like the weather and other systemic delays -- but when leaders step-up and do this kind of thing, it creates a lot of goodwill -- and is evidence that they are taking responsibility and trying to fix&#0160;things.&#0160;</p>

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p><em>I first posted this in 2011, but I update it now and then.&#0160; Note I have removed two from the list:<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465044549/bobsutton-20" target="_self"> Men and Women of the Corporatio</a><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0465044549/bobsutton-20" target="_self">n</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060523808/bobsutton-20" target="_self">Who Says that Elephants Can&#39;t Dance?</a>&#0160; They are both great books, but I am trying to stick to 12 books and the two new ones below edge them out. Here goes:<br /></em></p>
<p>I was looking through the books on Amazon to find something that struck my fancy, and instead, I started thinking about the books that have taught me much about people, teams, and organizations -- while at the same time -- provide useful guidance (if sometimes only indirectly) about what it takes to lead well versus badly.&#0160; The 12 books below are the result.&#0160;</p>
<p>Most are research based, and none are a quick read (except for <em>Orbiting the Giant Hairball)</em>. I guess this reflects my bias.&#0160; I like books that have real substance beneath them.&#0160; This runs counter the belief in the business book world at the moment that all books have to be both short and simple.&#0160; So, if your kind of business book is<a href="https://www.amazon.com/One-Minute-Manager-Kenneth-Blanchard/dp/0688014291/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324403987&amp;sr=8-1" target="_self"><em> The One Minute Manager </em></a>(which frankly, I like too... but you can read the whole thing in 20 or 30 minutes), then you probably won&#39;t like most of these books at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/142219857X/bobsutton-20" target="_self">1. The Progress Principle</a> by Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer.&#0160; A masterpiece of evidence-based management -- the strongest argument I know that &quot;the big things are the little things.&quot;&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/006124189X/bobsutton-20" target="_self">2. Influence</a> by Robert Cialdini the now classic book about how to persuade people to do things, how to defend against persuasion attempts, and the underlying evidence.&#0160; I have been using this in class at Stanford for over 20 years, and I have had dozens of students say to me years later &quot;I don&#39;t remember much else about the class, but I still use and think about that Cialdini book.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400064287/bobsutton-20" target="_self">3.Made to Stick</a> Chip and Dan Heath.&#0160; A modern masterpiece, the definition of an instant classic.&#0160; How to design ideas that people will remember and act on. &#0160; I still look at it a couple times a month and I buy two or three copies at a time because people are always borrowing it from me.&#0160; I often tell them to keep it because they rarely give it back anyway.&#0160;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374275637/bobsutton-20" target="_self">4. Thinking, Fast and Slow</a> Daniel Kahneman.&#0160; Even though the guy won the Nobel Prize, this book is surprisingly readable.&#0160; A book about how we humans really think, and although it isn&#39;t designed to do this, Kahneman also shows how much of the stuff you read in the business press is crap.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1422115151/bobsutton-20" target="_self">5. Collaboration</a> by Morten Hansen.&#0160; He has that hot bestseller now with Jim Collins called <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Great-Choice-Uncertainty-Luck--Why-Despite/dp/0062120999/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324404692&amp;sr=8-1" target="_self"><em>Great By Choice</em></a>, which I need to read. This is a book I have read three times and is -- by far -- the best book ever written about what it takes to build an organization where people share information, cooperate, and help each other succeed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670879835/bobsutton-20" target="_self">6. Orbiting the Giant Hairball</a> by Gordon MacKenzie.&#0160; It is hard to explain, sort of like trying to tell a stranger about rock and roll as the old song goes.&#0160; But it is the best creativity book ever written, possibly the business book related to business ever written.&#0160; Gordon&#39;s voice and love creativity and self-expression -- and how to make it happen despite the obstacles that unwittingly heartless organizations put in the way -- make this book a joy.</p>
<p>7<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0307265757/bobsutton-20" target="_self">. The Pixar Touch</a> by David Price.&#0160; After reading this book, my main conclusion was that it seems impossible that Pixar exists. Read how Ed Catmull along with other amazing characters-- after amazing setbacks, weird moments, and one strange twist after another -- realized Ed&#39;s dream after working on it for decades.&#0160; Ed is working on his own book right now, I can hardly wait to see that.&#0160; When I think of Ed and so many others I have met at Pixar like Brad Bird, I know it is possible to be a creative person without being an asshole.&#0160; In fact, at least if the gossip I keep hearing from Pixar people is true, Jobs was rarely rude or obnoxious in his dealings with people at Pixar because he knew they knew more than him -- and even he was infected by Pixar&#39;s norm of civility.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812993012/bobsutton-20" target="_self">8. Creativity,Inc.</a> by Ed Catmull. Price&#39;s book is fantastic, but this is one of the best business/leadership/organization design books ever written. &#0160;As I wrote in my blurb -- and this is no B.S.- &quot;“This is the best book ever written on what it takes to build a creative organization. It is the best because Catmull’s wisdom, modesty, and self-awareness fill every page. He shows how Pixar’s greatness results from connecting the specific little things they do (mostly things that anyone can do in any organization) to the big goal that drives everyone in the company: making films that make them feel proud of one another.” &#0160;Note also that Catmull has a chapter on Steve Jobs that offers a different perspective than anyone else I have seen --and they worked together for decades.</p>
<p>9.<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0071795618/bobsutton-20" target="_self">&#0160;The Laws of Subtraction</a> by Matthew May.&#0160;&#0160; This 2012 book has more great ideas about how to get rid of what you don&#39;t need and how to keep -- and add -- what you do need than any book ever written.&#0160; Matt has as engaging a writing style as I have ever encountered and he uses it to teach one great principle after another, from &quot;what isn&#39;t there can trump what is&quot; to &quot;doing something isn&#39;t always better than doing nothing.&quot;&#0160; Then each principle is followed with five or six very short -- and well-edited pieces -- from renowned and interesting people of all kinds ranging from executives, to researchers, to artists.&#0160; It is as fun and useful as non-fiction book can be and is useful for designing every part of your life, not just workplaces.</p>
<p>10<a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1578513332/bobsutton-20" target="_self">. Leading Teams</a> by J. Richard Hackman.&#0160; When it comes to the topic of groups or teams, there is Hackman and there is everyone else.&#0160;&#0160; If you want a light feel good romp that isn&#39;t very evidence-based, read<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wisdom-Teams-High-Performance-Organization-Essentials/dp/0060522003/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324406186&amp;sr=8-1" target="_self"><em> The Wisdom of Teams</em></a>.&#0160; If want to know how teams really work and what it really takes to build, sustain, and lead them from a man who has been immersed in the problem as a researcher, coach, consultant, and designer for over 40 years, this is the book for you.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0670026557/bobsutton-20" target="_self">11. Give and Take</a></em> by <a href="http://www.management.wharton.upenn.edu/grant/" target="_self">Adam Grant</a>. Adam is the hottest organizational researcher of his generation.&#0160; When I read the pre-publication version, I was so blown away by how useful, important, and interesting that <em>Give and Tak</em>e was that I gave it the most enthusiastic blurb of my life: “<em>Give and Take</em> just might be the most important book of this young century. As insightful and entertaining as Malcolm Gladwell at his best, this book has profound implications for how we manage our careers, deal with our friends and relatives, raise our children, and design our institutions. This gem is a joy to read, and it shatters the myth that greed is the path to success.&quot;&#0160; In other words, Adam shows how and why you don&#39;t need to be a selfish asshole to succeed in this life. America -- and the world -- would be a better place if all of memorized and applied Adam&#39;s worldview.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0671244094/bobsutton-20" target="_self">12. The Path Between the Seas</a> by historian David McCullough. On building the Panama Canal.&#0160; This is a great story of how creativity happens at a really big scale. It is messy. Things go wrong. People get hurt. But they also triumph and do astounding things.&#0160; I also like this book because it is the antidote to those who believe that great innovations all come from start-ups and little companies (although there are some wild examples of entrepreneurship in the story -- especially the French guy who designs Panama&#39;s revolution -- including a new flag and declaration of independence as I recall -- from his suite in the Waldorf Astoria in New York, and successfully sells the idea to Teddy Roosevelt ).&#0160; As my Stanford colleague Jim Adams points out, the Panama Canal, the Pyramids, and putting a man on moon are just a few examples of great human innovations that were led by governments.&#0160;&#0160;</p>
<p>I would love to know of your favorites -- and if want a systematic approach to this question, don&#39;t forget <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591842409/bobsutton-20" target="_self">The 100 Best Business Books of All Time</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. Also, for self-defense, I recommend that we all read Isaacson&#39;s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1451648537/bobsutton-20" target="_self">Steve Jobs</a> -- I still keep going places -- cocktail parties, family gatherings, talks I give and attend, and even the grocery store where people start talking about Jobs and especially arguing about him.&#0160; As I explained in <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/07/wired-story-wraps-with-my-argument-that-steve-jobs-is-like-a-rorschach-test.html" target="_self">Wired </a>and <em>Good Boss, Bad Boss</em> I have come to believe that whatever Jobs was in life, in death he has become a Rorschach test -- we all just project our beliefs and values on him.</p>

<a class="asset-img-link" href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e2017d3e0de6ee970c-pi" style="display: inline;"><img alt="Vonnegut Postcard" border="0" class="asset  asset-image at-xid-6a00d83451b75569e2017d3e0de6ee970c" src="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b75569e2017d3e0de6ee970c-800wi" title="Vonnegut Postcard" /></a></p>
<p><em>It is Thanksgiving morning here in California and I was thinking of all the good things in my life I have to be thankful for, just as I know that so many of you are thinking today.&#0160; I thought it would be nice to reprint a story and poem I first posted on this blog over five years ago, on the day The No Asshole Rule was published and it was updated shortly after on the day Vonnegut died.&#0160; The key part is Vonnegut&#39;s Joe Heller poem, one of the last things he published before he died.&#0160; His message that reminding ourselves how much we have (rather than how much we want), that so many of us &quot;have enough,&quot; is timeless and especially fitting for the day.&#0160; Enjoy and have a happy Thanksgiving.</em> </p>
<p>&#0160;I just heard that Kurt Vonnegut died. I loved his books and was touched by his sweet contribution, for creating the best moment I had when writing the book. His death makes me sad to think about, but his life brings me joy. All of us die in the end, it is the living that counts -- and Vonnegut touched so many people. Here is my story.</p>
<p>The process of writing <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Asshole-Rule-Civilized-Workplace-Surviving/dp/0446526568/sr=1-1/qid=1172208436/ref=sr_1_1/104-0865572-7534322?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books"><em>The No Asshole Rule</em></a> entailed many fun twists and turns.&#0160; But the very best thing happened when I wrote for permission to reprint a Kurt Vonnegut poem called &quot;Joe Heller,&quot; which was published in <em>The New Yorker.&#0160; </em>I was hoping that Vonnegut would give me permission to print it in the book, both because I love the poem (more on that later), and Vonnegut is one my heroes.&#0160; His books including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Slaughterhouse-Five-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/0385333846/sr=8-4/qid=1172207651/ref=pd_bbs_sr_4/104-0865572-7534322?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Slaughterhouse Five</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Breakfast-Champions-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/0385334206/ref=pd_sim_b_4/104-0865572-7534322">Breakfast of Champions</a> had a huge effect on me when I was a teenager-- both the ideas and the writing style.</p>
<p>I wrote some anonymous<em> New Yorker</em> address to ask permission to reprint the poem, and to my amazement, I received this personal reply from Vonnegut about two weeks later. Take a look at the two sides of the postcard, it not only is in Vonnegut&#39;s handwriting and gives me permission to use it &quot;however you please without compensation or further notice to me,&quot; the entire thing is designed by Vonnegut (and I suspect his wife helped, as she is a designer).&#0160; &quot;Life is No Way to Treat an Animal&quot; is one of the famous sayings from his character Kilgore Trout -- even the stamp is custom.&#0160; It is one of my favorite things.</p>
<p>The poem fits well in my chapter on how to avoid catching asshole poisoning.&#0160; Here is how I set it up in the book:<br /><br />&#39;If you read or watch TV programs about
business or sports, you often see the world framed as place where everyone
wants “more more more” for “me me me,” every minute in every way.
The old bumper sticker sums it up: “Whoever dies with the most toys wins.” The
potent but usually unstated message is that we are all trapped in a life-long
contest where people can never get enough money, prestige, victories, cool
stuff, beauty, or sex – and that we do want and should want more goodies than
everyone else. 
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">This attitude fuels a quest for constant
improvement that has a big upside, leading to everything from more beautiful
athletic and artistic performances, to more elegant and functional products, to
better surgical procedures and medicines, to more effective and humane
organizations. Yet when taken too far,
this blend of constant dissatisfaction, unquenchable desires, and overbearing
competitiveness can damage your mental health. It can lead you to treat those “below” you as inferior creatures who are
worthy of your disdain and people &quot;above&quot; you who have more stuff and status as
objects of envy and jealousy. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 150%;">Again, a bit of framing can help. Tell yourself, “I have enough.” Certainly,
some people need more than they have, as many people on earth still need a safe
place to live, enough good food to eat, and other necessities. But too many of
us are never satisfied and feel constantly slighted, even though – by objective
standards – we have all we need to live a good life. I got this idea from a lovely little poem
that Kurt Vonnegut published in <em>The New
Yorker </em>called “Joe Heller,” which was about the author of the renowned
World War II novel <em>Catch 22. </em> As you can see, the poem describes a party
that Heller and Vonnegut attended at a billionaire’s house. Heller remarks to Vonnegut that he has
something that the billionaire can never have, &quot;The knowledge that I&#39;ve
got enough.&quot; These wise words
provide a frame that can help you be at peace with yourself and to treat those
around you with affection and respect:</p>
<p><strong>Joe Heller </strong><strong>&#0160;</strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
True story, Word of Honor: <br />
Joseph Heller, an important and funny writer <br />
now dead, <br />
and I were at a party given by a billionaire <br />
on Shelter Island. </p>
<p>
I said, &quot;Joe, how does it make you feel <br />
to know that our host only yesterday <br />
may have made more money <br />
than your novel &#39;Catch-22&#39; <br />
has earned in its entire history?&quot; <br />
And Joe said, &quot;I&#39;ve got something he can never have.&quot; <br />
And I said, &quot;What on earth could that be, Joe?&quot; <br />
And Joe said, &quot;The knowledge that I&#39;ve got enough.&quot; <br />
Not bad! Rest in peace!&quot; </p>
<p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(Reprinted with Kurt Vonnegut’s permission -- see the above postcard!)</p>
<p>P.S. I also added another post about Vonnegut after this one that was good fun, which talked about <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/02/my_favorite_von.html">my favorite quote</a>.</p>
<p>P.P.S. The first version of this post was written on February 22nd, the day<em> The No Asshole Rul</em>e was published.&#0160; I then updated in mid-April of 2007, after I heard that Vonnegut had died.&#0160; This is the third update because it seems like such a&#0160; great Thanksgiving message.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">

			<div class="entry-body">
				<p>About 15 years ago, UC Berkeley&#39;s <a href="http://facultybio.haas.berkeley.edu/faculty-list/staw-barry" target="_self">Barry Staw</a>
 and I had a running conversation about the conditions under which 
showing anger, even having a temper tantrum, is strategic versus 
something that undermines a person&#39;s reputation and influence, and for 
leaders, the performance of their teams and organizations.&#0160; In fact, 
Barry eventually collected some amazing in-the-locker room half-time 
speeches for basketball coaches that he is currently&#0160; working on writing
 and publishing.&#0160;</p>
<p> I thought of those old conversations when I got
 this amazing note the other day (this is the same one that inspired me 
to do my last post on the <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2012/11/the-marketoonist-on-attila-the-manager-.html" target="_self">Atilla the Manager</a> cartoon):</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">I just discovered your work via Tom Fishburne, the Marketoonist. I had an
asshole boss until I got her fired. For 6 years I was abused and I should have
done what you say and got out as soon as I could. But you get comfortable and
used to the abuse. You even think you are successfully managing the abusers
behavior with your behavior. Ridiculous I know. I suffered everything you
mentioned including depression, anxiety and just plain unhappiness. The day I
snapped, I used the &quot;I quit and I&#39;m taking you down with me&quot; tactic.
I did document the abuse even though just like every asshole situation, everyone
knew she was an abuser. In an impassioned meeting I let top management know
exactly why I was quitting, let them know they are culpable for all the mental
anquish and turnover and poor results stemming from the asshole. They probably
thought I was a madman with nothing left to lose and about to sue and defame
the company (they&#39;d have been correct). Two hours later she was walked out. Now
the department is doing great and actually producing instead of trying to
manage the reactions of a lunatic.</p>
<p>I am taken with this note for 
numerous reasons.&#0160; For starters, I am always delighted when the victim 
of an asshole finds a successful way to to fight back.&#0160; I am also 
pleased to see&#0160; that, as happens so often, once this creep was sent 
packing, people could stop spending their days trying to deal with her 
antics and instead could devote their energies to doing their jobs well.
 And in thinking about it in more detail -- and thinking back to those 
old conversations with Barry -- I believe that showing anger was 
effective in this situation for at least three reasons.</p>
<p><strong>1. He was right.</strong>
 This was, as the headline says, an evidence-based temper tantrum.&#0160; 
Although his superiors may have not been overly pleased with how he 
delivered the news, he apparently had darn good evidence that this 
person was an asshole and doing harm to him and his co-workers. Facts 
matter, even when emotions flare. </p>
<p><strong>2. His anger was a reflection of how others felt, not just his particular quirks and flaws</strong>.&#0160;
 This outpouring of anger and the ultimatum he gave were seen as giving 
voice to how everyone who worked with this &quot;lunatic&quot; felt.&#0160; It was his 
tantrum, but it was on behalf of and gave voice to others.&#0160; In such 
situations, when a person is not seen as out of touch reality or crazy, 
even though he may have felt or even acted like a &quot;madman&quot; for the 
moment, the anger and refusal to give in can be very powerful.&#0160; I also 
suspect that, in this case, those same bosses who fired him felt he same
 way about the local asshole, and his anger propelled them to take an 
action they knew was the right thing to do. The notion that emotions are
 contagious and propel action is quite well established in a lot of 
studies (see research by <a href="http://www.elainehatfield.com/" target="_self">Elaine Hatfield</a> for example).&#0160;</p>
<p><strong>3. The was a rare tantrum.</strong>&#0160;
 This follows from the last point.&#0160; If you are always ranting and 
yelling and making threats, people aren&#39;t likely to take you 
seriously.&#0160;&#0160; Tantrums are effective when they are seen as a rare and 
justified outburst rather than a personal characteristic -- as something
 that is more easily attributed to the bad situation the person is in 
rather than personal weakness or style. </p>
<p>Please, please don&#39;t use 
this fellow&#39;s success as a reason to start yelling and making threats 
and all that.&#0160; That is what a certified asshole would do.&#0160; But -- while 
such outbursts are not always the product of rational planning -- this 
little episode provides instructive guidance about when expressing anger
 might produce outcomes for the greater good.&#0160; It also provides some 
interesting hints about when it is best to try to stop outbursts from 
those you are close to versus when egging them on is a reasonable thing 
to do.</p>
<p>Finally, a big thanks to the anonymous writer of this note.&#0160; I learned something from it and I hope that other do as well.</p>
P.S. This note and post makes me think that some revision to my list of <a href="https://bobsutton.typepad.com/my_weblog/2007/08/the-latest-tips-1.html" target="_self">Tips for Surviving Workplace Assholes </a>might be in order.
